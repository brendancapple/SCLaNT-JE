"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara Michinaga, ""Tohbojo Kazunaga Kyo no Ki"" on August 1, 1494, it is said in a secret document that Ikkyu Sojun is the illegitimate child of Emperor Gotsuchimikado."
"""There is no one in the world who knows it."""
"His childhood name was Chigikumaru, according to later historical records."
"He was known as Zhou Jian, and also went by the names Kuang Yunzi, Xialu, and Mukei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shushun, also written as Shunjun."
Ikyu is a Buddhist monk's title.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist names"" section for information on posthumous Buddhist names and Dharma names."
"At the age of 6, he entered the Image-Gazing Society at Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, received initiation, and was given the name Shuken."
"He excelled in poetry from an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Naganoharu"" composed at the age of 13 and ""Harukimiyoru"" composed at the age of 15 became popular and received praise in the capital."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Sōi and changed his Buddhist name to Sōjun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's actions were caused by his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of the Ōei era (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a prominent monk at Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto."
"He received the Buddhist name ""Ikkyu"" from the master Hozan after answering the koan ""The stick of Dongshan strikes three times"" with the verse: ""Returning from the land of nothingness, take a break. When it rains, let it pour. When the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Having (world of defilements)"" refers to the world of delusion (mental afflictions), and ""Not having (world of no defilements)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddhahood)."
"One night in the 27th year of Ōei (1420), upon hearing the cry of a crow, I suddenly came to a great realization."
"The old man tried to give him the certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, wild songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shochou (1428), Emperor Gokomatsu passed away without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Hanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and ascended to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Nara.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the East Sea""."
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio claims that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono was approved by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era following the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the 47th head priest of Daikaku-ji by imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and although he did not reside in the temple, he worked tirelessly for its revival."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo Imperial Visit during the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and it was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it was also referred to as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to the Ritsuryo due to damage caused by wars and other factors."
"The Togu-in Palace in the Daitokuji Temple complex was one of the imperial residences where the Emperor's family of the Jimyo-in lineage, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which came to be called the Southern Court, was located within the Nijo Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the original Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Tokyo Imperial Palace was established in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property classified as ""Imperial property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sentō Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north on Imadegawa Avenue are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both located on the Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Residents of Kyoto often simply refer to Kyoto Imperial Palace as ""Gosho,"" including Kyoto Gyoen."
"There is a theory that the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high, unlike overseas castles, due to the difference in the sense of closeness between the common people and rulers (emperors and imperial family) in the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This is one of the reasons why such incidents have not occurred in Japan."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the Nijo Station of West Japan Railway, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the retired Emperor, called the Tsuchimikado Higashifushimi-no-miya, and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of the Genko era (1331)."
"The Inner Palace that was here was rebuilt eight times only in the Edo period (six of which were rebuilt due to fires), and the existing building was rebuilt in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855) following the Heian style, and is called the Ansei Inner Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deterioration of the Kyoto Imperial Palace within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered that the palace be preserved and its old appearance maintained."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Oshoin, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, it was stipulated by the 1889 Imperial Household Law that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai ceremony should be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"In addition, there is no specific provision in the current Imperial Household Law enacted after World War II that the enthronement ceremony must be held in Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time in history at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing the enthronement, which is located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Sokuirei-Seiden-no-Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishin-den-no-Gi"") was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"It is a four-legged gate with a plain wood, gabled roof, cypress bark roof, and a pillar spacing of one bay."
"The gate is opened only for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, important guests, or public tours."
"In the left and right walls of Tsukiji, there are five horizontal lines, which also indicate the highest level of formality as a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the red-painted tile-roofed Shouming Gate, you will arrive at the front of the Purple Forbidden City."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on Japanese gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Gakubu (Important Intangible Cultural Property).
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Section in Japan, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Section, excluding Western music."
Many are inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the oldest style of traditional music performed in a large ensemble format even today.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form of gagaku, it had been interrupted for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate reorganized it by gathering the descendants of musicians (gakka). Therefore, it is questionable how much of the form from the Heian period has been inherited."
"It is speculated that when singing the score written in katakana of the hichiriki as a chant (chanting the melody to memorize it by adding rhythm to the musical notation), the pronunciation of the ""ha"" row is pronounced as fa, fi, fu, fe, fo, and other characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century are faithfully reproduced, making it quite accurate overall."
"Things written in kanji, like the notation of the ""raku biwa,"" have many similarities with the biwa notation found in Dunhuang, China, and many styles passed down from an even older continent are further inherited."
"One of the most important historical sources is the ""Taigen Shō"" written by Toyohara Noriaki (1450-1512), who was concerned about the dispersal of records such as gagaku due to the Ōnin War."
"Tsugua Tsugua, a member of the Gagaku family, compiled records on Gagaku and Bugaku centered around the shō, making it a valuable record of ancient Gagaku."
"The music for rituals that originated from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, it is said that Tang music, which originated from music played at banquets called Yan Yue in Tang Dynasty China, was introduced."
"As for the category of music, various international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (music of Champa) are transmitted, and elements of ancient Japanese music from before the introduction of music from the continent are also included."
"Before modern times, the oldest styles were transmitted through the Sanpogakusho at Shitennoji Temple in Tennoji (Osaka), the Dainagonakusho at the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakusho at Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara)."
"These places of music were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the basis of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each place of music continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences can be seen between folk songs and statements, leading to the creation of Japan's unique style."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of S-style traditional Japanese music and dance.
Items that have been brought from outside Japan (some consider only these to be gagaku).
"Left dance・Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Linyi (South Vietnam) origins."
"Right Dance, Goryeo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) lineage."
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned styles (Japanese music).
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period
Refer to the lyrics.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances in the national style and recitations are collectively referred to as ancient songs.
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shinno Kagami, the mother, is a descendant of the Baekje royal family, descended from King Munheung of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro bore Prince Yasumikado (later Emperor Heijō), and Princess Fujiwara no Tabiko bore Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Hakuheki, ascended the throne, it was not desired for him to become crown prince because his mother, Takano Shinkasa, was of low status as a member of the immigrant clan, the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the center."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan and others, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue Naishinno, were suddenly deposed, and Prince Tokiwa was appointed Crown Prince on January 2, 773, in the fourth year of the Hoki era."
"Disliking the increasing influence of Nara Buddhism temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, but in 794, Heian-kyo was newly built."
"To invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi, a military force was sent with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Commander-in-Chief of the Conquest of the Emishi."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshiatsu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing suffering to the peasants with such military and architectural activities."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new movements to Japanese Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Kammu.
"Princess Inoue and Prince Hotta's unnatural deaths, at the beginning of his reign, also had a dark side in that his younger brother, Prince Hayara, who was designated as the Crown Prince, was exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu and died in exile."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Shōmu posthumously honored Prince Sōshi as Emperor Suwō and designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, restoring her position as Empress."
"While known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, the existing Buddhist sects exerted pressure on the so-called ""Nanto Rokushu"" factions by confiscating their land and imposing restrictions, as they were seen as having too much power involved in the government."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident at Yōkō"" and became a breeding ground for it."
"He passed away on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Emperor Jimmu, who was given the posthumous name Yamato Takeru Ama no Hihoko Ihare no Mikoto, established the Japanese imperial lineage."
"Along with that, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given a Chinese-style posthumous title."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tengoku Oshiwa no Miya Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is said to be the Kasihawara tomb (Kashiwabara no Misasagi) in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he had insisted on being buried in Utono, but for various reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"With the start of the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Mausoleum at the Imperial Palace.
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, which has become a tradition, Akihito made a statement during a press conference regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup in the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was widely reported in the South Korean media and became a hot topic."
"Some media outlets have made a big leap in logic, suggesting that the Imperial Family has Korean ancestry, citing theories such as the ""Imperial Family's Baekje Origins Theory."""
"The Otani family (Ootanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsun."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking nobleman in Kyoto, while Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest of Honganji, the largest sect of Jodo Shinshu."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo), which split in 1602, took on surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum at the Otani area north of the Chion-in Temple's main gate in Higashiyama, Kyoto, as mentioned later."
"Hongan-ji was considered one of the daimyo during the Warring States period in Japan due to its power as a result of the spread of the Ikko Ikki movement. It is common to refer to the head priest with the title of Hongan-ji Kenshu or Hongan-ji Kosai, but this is only for convenience and does not mean that the head priest's family lineage made Hongan-ji their family name or surname, nor that there was a Hongan-ji clan."
"Kakushin-ni watched over Shinran as he passed away in 1262, and in 1272 she built a hall in Otani near their home in Higashiyama, Kyoto to enshrine his remains."
"Daibutsu-do became a place of worship for the followers of Jodo Shinshu as Shinran's mausoleum, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, was appointed as the caretaker to manage it in his absence."
"However, Daibyo-do Temple later became a source of conflict between the disciples of various provinces, as they vied for the position of head priest and the donations that came with it. This led to a dispute between Kakunyo's son Kakunyo and his half-brother Yosho, with Kakunyo ultimately emerging victorious and establishing the hereditary succession of the head priest position within his own family line."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Daishonin Honzanji."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Honganji Temple, and advanced the formation of the religious sect. By the time of the 5th generation, Jitsunyo, in the Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation, Sonnyo, the Honganji Temple sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming their religious organizations since after Shinran's death, the formation of our denomination has been significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a sub-temple of Seiren-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's birth family), also acted as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of the teachings of Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Tomogashi clan by the Honganji sect in Kaga, resulting in the emergence of a situation known as the ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from humble farmers, utilized its organizational strength to expand its activities throughout Japan, reaching the warrior class such as samurais and local lords. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532, leading to war damage. The 10th head, Shonin, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as the Ishiyama Honganji temple."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located on the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodogawa River was controlled by Osaka.
"Based at Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shonin Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Jisho era, in regions such as Hokuriku, some members of the Honganji sect were beginning to deviate from the control of the Honganji and follow their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head, Kenju, of the Shonin sect, the Honganji sect, which had become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away feudal power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan, which lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple fortified at Ishiyama and cooperating with its followers across the country in resisting the Oda clan. This alliance allowed the Honganji Temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its domain."
"Despite maintaining strong influence by gathering support from various factions such as the Iga clan, Ishiyama Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, finally succumbing to Nobunaga who obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, the temple was forced to retreat from Ishiyama and its power as a feudal lord ceased to exist."
"At this time, there was a disagreement between Jokyoju and Kenjo, who advocated for continuing to resist against the intentions of Kenjo. When Kenjo passed away in 1593, his third son Junjo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple began to walk the path of division over the position of the head priest, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted a separate temple ground to Kyonyo's Honganji sect, separate from the Honganji sect led by Kyonyo, establishing the Eastern Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers from the Jodo Shinshu sect led by Junyo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, moved to the sect led by Kyonyo of Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into East and West."
"Originally, Shinran, a son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the heads of the Eastern and Western Ootani families, who trace their lineage back to Hino Hirotsun (the father of Kakunyo), had a custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles, and also continued to intermarry with court nobles for generations, thus furthering their court noble status through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotanabe City is located in the central part of the triangular area of three prefectures, in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, adjacent to Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows along the east side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture) from north to south, while the city is sandwiched between the Ikoma mountain range on the west side. The central area is crossed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe Town in Tsukimi District was incorporated as a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was established for the first time in 20 years, as the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District was renamed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" by adding the prefix ""Kyoto"" to become ""Kyotanabe City"", and the town was upgraded to a city (city system enforcement). On the same day, the name change of ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" was also implemented."
The new city name was selected through a general public offering.

The statue of Zen master Ikkyu and the famous garden have been designated as important cultural properties.
"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintoku Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyamate Station."
"Kintetsu Nintoku Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, regular trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line also stop at Kintetsu Nintoku Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikatsumi Station and Higashikatsumi Station.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the name ""Kii"" from the old province name of Wakayama is used for stations in Tanabe City to avoid duplication of station names within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."

Musashi Province was one of the ancient administrative divisions in Japan.
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in the current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is the provincial governor, national class division, and distant provinces."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in the area that now corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, spanning across Katsura District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province. It was a capital city divided into a rectangular grid measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Establishing the Imperial Palace at the north end of the capital, and from there creating the Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city, with the districts of Sakyo to the left and Ukyo to the right (the east side being Sakyo and the west side being Ukyo)."
"The layout plan basically follows the Heijokyo, and is modeled after the Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"However, there were no city walls."
There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to the Feng Shui transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current city of Kyoto.
"The northernmost main road is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern boundary of the Kujo Oji is Kujo Street slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
The eastern limit of Tokyo's greatest road corresponds to the present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Saigen on Nishikyogoku Oji is a line connecting JR West's Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station north and south.
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring approximately 40 meters on each side, separated by major and minor roads running in the cardinal directions."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district was assigned a number.
"As a result, each town was called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho""."
"Even small roads were four jo (about 12 meters) wide, while major roads were eight jo (about 24 meters) wide or more."
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the entrance to Suzaku Avenue, there was a width of 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, there were rivers (Horikawa and Nishi Horikawa) flowing parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu lineage in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi lineage."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This re-relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents that began with the assassination of Fujiwara Tane-tsugu in Nagaoka-kyo and led to the demotion of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the building of the Imperial Palace (Dai Dairi), followed by the construction of the city (urban area)."
"However, due to the wetland formed by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), the area of Ukyo did not urbanize even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had mostly become obsolete, there were cases of land being converted to agricultural use, which was originally prohibited within the capital."
"The residential areas of the nobility were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital close to the Daidairi."
"The Nihon Koki is a chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the six national histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of the Jōwa era (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tenchō era (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara Shoshi and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Three people, excluding the unfinished succession, died, so Emperor Junna later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Prince Naoyuki, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakamoto Imatsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue the succession."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyo, further decrees were issued, ordering Fujiwara no Morotsugu, Minamoto Tsunemoto, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatoro to carry out their duties."
"Furthermore, after adding Furu Takaniwa and Yamada Furutsugu, the completion was finally reported on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841) in the 7th year of the Jōwa era."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Shoshi."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text records the reigns of Emperor Heijou, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna during the reign of Emperor Kammu."
"In the early 15th century, there were 40 volumes of the text, but they were later scattered. It was not until the disciple of Hanawa Hokiichi, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family that it was first published. (There is also a theory that it was edited by Yagiwara Norimitsu.)"
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijou), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), with a total of 10 volumes, and the reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"By extracting excerpts from works such as ""Nihon Shoki Ryaku"" and using the classification of topics in ""Ruiju Kokushi"" from the Six National Histories, it is possible to partially reconstruct the text."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"" which collect excerpts from various places, based on which Shueisha's annotated Japanese historical materials and Kodansha's academic pocketbooks have been published."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Michitsugu.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Nihon Shoki,"" and is the same as subsequent historical books."
"However, the obituary of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but rather contains many interesting descriptions that include unique criticisms and impressions, making it unusual in the history of the Six Kingdoms for maintaining a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical records.
Sei Shonagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"One of the Five Women of the Pear Jar, she was the daughter of the renowned poet Sei Shonagon (908-990) in his later years."
"There is an old tradition that identifies my mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a fanciful and groundless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become wives of Gagaku Head Tamenari, Dazai Shokan, Kaisyu, and Hanayama-in Denjo Hoshi Kaihide, as well as Fujiwara Norin (the siblings of Fujiwara Michitune's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is the pen name of a court lady, with ""Sei"" taken from her family name of Seiwa Genji and ""Shonagon"" from her father's official title."
"The real name is unknown, although there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Shou""), but it is not trustworthy."
"She is counted as one of the thirty-six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection ""Kiyoshonagonshu"" consists of 42 poems (though the number of poems varies in different versions, with 31 poems in the circulated version)."
"In the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" fourteen poems were selected for inclusion in an imperial anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father is the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"The mother is Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"At first he was a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"Then, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, he proceeded to Kyoto and assumed the position of the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and, in coordination with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, built a siege network around Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate effectively collapsed."
"After that, he received support from Mōri Terumoto and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and spent the rest of his life."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was Ashikaga Yoshiteru, who was the heir to his older brother, he became the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofukuji Ichijo-in) under the name Kakukei."
He later advanced to the position of Gonsuke Sodai in Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiteru, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Sanjo Sanemitsu, and my younger brother, Ashikaga Shusonin, who was the head of the Kano-in, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple (Hisahide and others feared that killing Yoshiaki, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of head priest of Kofukuji Temple in the future, would turn the temple into an enemy, so they decided to imprison him)."
"However, with the help of vassals Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Koremasa, he managed to escape and returned to secular life on February 17, 1566, taking the name Yoshiaki."
"In books that mention Yoshiteru, it is noted that he was also known by the alias of Buke Gosho, among other names."
"When he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also known as the ""Poor Governor""."
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank) and appointed as Sadenji (Left Horse Head)."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to the ""Gonki"" by Yamashina Genkei, it is clear that before the appointment, there was a confusion when an envoy of Yoshiaki appeared at Genkei's residence on the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshihide, who was a rival of Yoshiaki, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568) to request mediation for his promotion to Jushiishita."
"Yoshiaki, who escaped from Kyoto, initially relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshiyoshi and Rokkaku Yoshiharu in Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Sanjo Sanemitsu, so in August he fled to the Takeda Yoshinori in Wakasa Province, who was his sister's husband."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have enough power to go up to the capital due to succession struggles and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already had the ""Kuramaguchi Gosho"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and did not have the intention to actively go up to Kyoto with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, who had just returned to secular life, so the journey to Kyoto did not materialize."
"Yoshikage Asakura is serving as the head of the household. (It should be noted that there is no official documentation confirming that Yoshiaki had undergone the formal ceremony of coming of age up to this point, making his coming of age ceremony at this time unusually late for the era.)"
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, he moved to Mino Province to seek refuge with Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was enthroned by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank Lower Grade and appointed as a Councilor and Left Guard General."
The JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The Keihan Keishin Line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line), and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line on the Kinki Nippon Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is added."
"The line color is blue (■), and due to its position as the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in the shortest time of 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (maximum speed of 130km/h)."
"It is a double-track line in both directions for the entire section (outer track, inner track)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-SURF ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system is introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that run through the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan Hanshin Kanko Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"In addition, nearly half of the local trains will stop at Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After JR conversion, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Haku-to"" train to San'in which started operation with the opening of the Chizu Express, now operate directly to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section has increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating simultaneously with the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running to Kyoto on regular services one year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound ""Thunderbird"" express train."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains departing and arriving in Kyoto for Kyushu were completely abolished in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"Furthermore, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" from Shin-Osaka that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line, switch to the freight line at Ibaraki Station (departing from platform 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Box."
"Therefore, the limited express and new rapid trains running on the outer line may take slightly longer travel time, and depending on the time of day, there may be cases where two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The track alignment is extremely good along almost the entire Kyoto-Osaka line, and speeds of up to 130 km/h are possible on the outer tracks, except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling speeds of up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for positioning or special trains)."
The following are the limited express trains that run on this section.
"In addition, there are transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokukinki"" running on this section in relation to the entry and exit of vehicles at Mukonohama (Kyoto Integrated Operating Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohara and Osaka on the ""Thunderbird"" and ""Raicho"" services will pass through the Hokuhoku Freight Line."
"When storing a train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto Integrated Operations Center, proceed in the direction of Osaka Station after passing Tsukamoto Station, enter the north freight line from the west, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and back of the formation are reversed."
The Shin-Kaisoku service operates directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Aioi/Kamigori/Ako Line from Harima Ako direction to JR Kyoto Line via Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station/ Tsuruga.
"From daytime to nighttime, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Biwako Line, while the remaining three trains continue on the Kosei Line."
All four trains at night are through services to the Biwako Line.
Operated with 8 or 12 cars using JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 1000 series and JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Jukan Expressway is a high-standard arterial road with a length of approximately 100km, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"It runs vertically through the long north-south Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, promoting regional revitalization, and serving as the vulnerable southern outer ring road of the high-standard road network in the Kyoto metropolitan area."
"The governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, with the starting point side opening under the name of the Kyoto-Joyo Bypass instead of the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the term ""Kyoto Vertical Highway"" is often used to refer specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"In addition, the section between Kuyamayodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed expressway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage such as mopeds is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to only drive on the toll-free section."
"The Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji IC section, which is scheduled to open in the summer to fall of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current toll-free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be tolled."
"In accordance with this, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"As a result, the current Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, so there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe-Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is constructed in a manner that is close to a temporary prefabricated building.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanba Wachi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinokamioka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tsubakake IC to Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC started operating as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru-Oe IC opened, connecting to the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with temporary two-lane opposing traffic."
"October 1, 2005: Privatization of four road-related public corporations resulted in the transfer of ownership to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and management to the West Nippon Expressway Company."
The part where the background color of the IC number column is ■ indicates the section where the road is already in use.
"In addition, the sections with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that is not yet open is provisional.
MUJI has no BS.
The number is for another route.
&lt;Number&gt; is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire Mount Hiei with an elevation of 848 meters."
"Rather than being called by the name of Enryaku-ji, it is more often referred to as Mt. Hiei or Hiei-zan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"This is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the establishment of Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobu-ji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land practices were also conducted, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great influence and received reverence from the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the rituals of esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple competed with the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple (Tōmitsu) known as ""Daimitsu."""
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the three towers and sixteen valleys scattered from the eastern foot of Mount Hiei to the top of the mountain, such as the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokogawa."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, marking the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was allowed to be taken from the era name at the time of its founding, which was in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks, including Ennin, Enchin, the founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu school Ryōnin, the founder of the Jōdo school Hōnen, the founder of the Jōdo Shinshū school Shinran, the founder of the Rinzai school Eisai, the founder of the Sōtō school Dōgen, and the founder of the Nichiren school Nichiren. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning the temple the nickname ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year mountain retreat"" and the ""1000-day pilgrimage to sacred peaks"" have been continued to this day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki,"" and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyama Ikadzuchi-no-kami, the landowner deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20 in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), he received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a full-fledged monk."
"Hōnen sought a stable position at a major temple in Nara, but instead chose to dedicate himself to training and studying scriptures on Mount Hiei, near his hometown."
"Saicho regarded the teachings of the Lotus Sutra as the highest among the numerous scriptures, and studied the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi (""Mohe Zhiguan"", ""Mahāprajñāpāramitā Upadeśa"", and ""Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple called Ichijo Shikan-in on the current site of the Konpon Chudo, consisting of Yakushi-do, Monju-do, and a scripture repository."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"During the reign of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho relied on him and received assistance from the Emperor and the influential Wake clan, leading to the gradual prosperity of Mount Hiei as a dojo for national protection guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a mission ship."
Enchin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the Tendai master Dōshu and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōmanzashu at the sacred site of Mount Hiei.
"In addition, at the Ryoukou-ji Temple in Echizen (Shoukou), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunkyou Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is generally believed that the moon is deified as a god who rules over the night, but there are also alternative theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Nihon Shoki about the killing of Yasakatsumi, so although generally considered a male deity, there is no description in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and in many other countries' myths, goddesses with aggressive personalities also frequently appear. Therefore, some scholars argue for the theory that the moon god in the story of the killing of Yasoshima is a goddess, as there is no definitive evidence to conclude that it is a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and performed purification, while Amaterasu, born from his other eye, and Susanoo, born from his nose, together form the three noble children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there is a story that she was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and another story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, and her domain is not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in contrast to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Book of Historical Records of the Five Phases""), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and the identification of the two came about in later times."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to govern the day and night respectively, and separated light from darkness, telling the story of the creation of the sun and moon."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon being born as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in activity."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the Nihon Shoki, Volume 5, Chapter 11-1, about the origin of grains."
There is also a theory that balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationships between Amaterasu-Omikami and Takamimusubi, as well as between Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Umisachi-hiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susano'o and Susanoo are the same deity, as their domains and episodes overlap in some parts."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he was born when the right eye of Izanagi was washed, and is called one of the ""three noble children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi is ordered to ""inform the night food country"", but there is no further activity after this."
There is also a theory that there is a country called Yomi where the goddess Izanami resides.
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, the Age of the Gods, it is briefly mentioned that the Moon God was born to shine brightly after the Sun God, and was sent to the heavens to rule alongside the Sun. In the following section, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto gave birth to Obito no Mikoto while holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to Tsukiyumi no Mikoto while holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu Omikami in the realm of dominion, while there is also a story of being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tide of the Cang Hai Yuan (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of three gods are parallel."
"In the fifth paragraph of the Chronicles, it is said that Amaterasu Oomikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukuyomi no Mikoto was commanded to descend from the heavens to meet with the food-giving deity, Uke Mochi, sent by Amaterasu."
"In response, the god of food and agriculture, Hojokin, spat out rice as an offering. The moon god, Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, was disgusted and angry, so he killed Hojokin with a sword."
"From the dead body of the food god, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasano during the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the position of a practitioner (technician) who performs divination, geomancy, etc. based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and is later placed in charge of divination, sorcery, and general rituals beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"From the Middle Ages onwards, it came to refer mainly to non-official individuals who privately practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals in various places. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It may also be pronounced as ""on'yōji"" without gemination."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the arrival of the Five Classics scholars from Baekje in 512 (Emperor Keitai's 7th year) or the arrival of the divination scholar in 554 (Emperor Kinmei's 15th year)."
"Initially, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602 AD (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), the arrival of the pioneer of Onmyodo, Kanko, from Baekje to Japan had a significant impact on our country's national politics by teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Prince Shotoku."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Ganjitsu) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, envoys were sent to Sui, an advanced civilization, in 607 (15th year of Empress Suiko). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"After that, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the missions to Sui (later Tang) China, and also invited numerous monks and scholars from the Korean Peninsula's west coast or from mainland China to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has come to be considered important in Japan to predict the future by considering the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and judging good and bad luck based on the principles of the five elements generating and overcoming each other, in order to obtain guidance for various matters and determine actions based on good and bad fortune. As a result, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy has come to be emphasized as a strategy for judging good and bad luck and obtaining guidelines for actions."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of yin-yang and five elements philosophy, personally took a divining rod during the Jinshin War and established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first astrological observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin Yang Five Elements ideology became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasa-sho was explicitly stated. It was specified that officials such as astronomers, Onmyoji, calendar experts, and meteorologists would be permanently assigned to this bureau, alongside the Kuihoku officials of the Jingikan, to officially conduct divination."
"Those in charge of technology brought from the continent, are typically scholars and onmyoji who are proficient in various fields and skilled in reading Chinese texts. They are mostly immigrants from mainland China, who have held power in the past like the Former Han, Later Han, Sui dynasties, or from Goguryeo and Baekje on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally from Silla, which initially had power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of Tenji), in which Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Baekje dynasty. During this period, many scholars from Baekje sought refuge in Silla, and a significant number of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyo-ryo at the time of its establishment were purely divination, geomancy (similar to what is now called ""feng shui""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, judgment of auspicious and inauspicious days, and managing the calendar. Therefore, they mainly predicted astronomical observations, managed the calendar, and judged the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of Yin and Yang. They did not perform any religious ceremonies or rituals like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction work at the imperial court and in predicting the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyoryo as a legal official system and the duties of the Onmyoji.
"In the Onmyo Agency, there is an administrative official called an administrative officer."
