The Doshisha Corporation (Japanese: 学校法人同志社) is the school corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha was founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima as a Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) school, and is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational institutions bearing the name ""Doshisha"" from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, roughly 36,000 people are studying at Doshisha University."
"Currently, the school corporation Doshisha has obtained <AA+> from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is ranked second out of 21 levels of ratings.
"Alongside Waseda University and Keio University, it is the top educational institution as a school corporation."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience"" based on the spirit of Christianity."
Aritomo Yamagata aimed to cultivate individuals who could use their conscience and abilities effectively as the purpose of education.
"It is hoped to cultivate individuals with ""consciences filled with goodness"" by promoting ""character education"" based on Christianity alongside knowledge education."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting expressing those sentiments can be found in various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May the strength of conscience pervade the whole body"" are engraved on this monument of conscience."
"Furthermore, as an educational philosophy to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, ""Christianity"", ""liberalism"", and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
It is a Protestant educational corporation with a congregationalist church (union church) background.
"However, unlike so-called mission universities, they do not have the primary purpose of Christian evangelism (and do not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."

I was born in Kyoto and am said to be a descendant of Emperor Go-Komatsu.
"In the diary of Sugawara Nagamasa, ""Tohbojo Nagano Kyoko Ki"" on August 1st of the 3rd year of Meio (1494), it is written, ""It is said in secret that Ikkyu Osho is the illegitimate child of Emperor Gohan of Gosho."""
There is no one in the world who knows it.
"According to later historical records, his childhood name was Chigikumaru."
"He was known by the name Zhou Jian as he grew older, and went by the nicknames ""Crazy Cloud Child,"" ""Blind Donkey,"" ""Dream Chamber,"" and others."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Soshun, also written as Soshun."
Ikyu is a monastic name.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist names"" section for information on posthumous Buddhist names and temple names."
"At the age of six, he entered the Angokoji in Kyoto and received the precepts, and was given the name Shuken."
"From an early age, he excelled in poetry. His Chinese poems ""Changan Spring Grass,"" written at the age of 13, and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Flowers,"" written at the age of 15, became renowned and praised in Luoyang."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Soi and changed his Buddhist name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be confirmed whether Ikkyu's behavior is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Ōei (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a high priest at the Daikaku-ji temple in Kyoto."
"One day, when faced with the koan ""The stick of Dongshan's three pounds,"" he replied: ""Returning from no place, take a rest. When it rains, let it pour; when the wind blows, let it blow."" Because of this answer, he received the title of ""Ikkyu"" from Hoso."
"""Arroji (sensual world)"" refers to the world of delusion (defilements), while ""muroji (nirvana)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddhahood)."
"One night in the 27th year of the Oei era (1420), upon hearing the cry of a crow, I suddenly have a great realization."
"The old man tried to give a written permission, but Ikkyu declined."
It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, eccentric verse, calligraphy, and painting."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Go-Komatsu passed away without leaving any male heirs, and was succeeded by Emperor Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Goshirakawa.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the Tokai Region."""
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono Emperor was supported by the shogunate, and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the sixth year of the Bunmei era following the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the head priest of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. Although he did not reside in the temple, he devoted himself to its revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Emperor's visit to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, he moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), which was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been known as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of the city, but it was later moved to the residence of the retired Emperor due to devastation caused by wars and other factors."
"The Togu-do-in Palace of the Daitokuji Temple was one of the palaces in this village, where the Imperial Family of the Jomyo-in line, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which came to be called the Southern Court, was located at Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Dōmiyon-Higashidono-in, but an expansion based on the Dōmiyon-Higashidono-in."
"Usually, it is possible to visit by applying, and it is also open to the public in spring and autumn."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Tokyo Imperial Palace visit in 1869, the second year of the Meiji era."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property and classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace, Sentō Imperial Palace, and across from the northern neighboring Imadegawa Street are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both located on the Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to it as ""Gosho,"" including the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"It is worth noting that unlike castles in other countries, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. Some argue that this difference reflects the varying degrees of familiarity between the common people and the rulers (emperors and imperial family members) in Eastern and Western cultures."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). Such incidents have not occurred in Japan, which is one of the bases for this observation."
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located considerably west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a position northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near JR Nijo Station in Kyoto."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences called Satonaidai, and it was called the Tsuchimikado Higashitoin Palace. It was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of Genko (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that used to be here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period (six times due to fires), and the existing building, reconstructed in the late Edo period in the style of the Heian era in the second year of Ansei (1855), is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), when Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto, he lamented the deteriorating condition of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo, and ordered that the palace be preserved and its old appearance maintained."
"Major buildings include the Shishin-den, Seiryo-den, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den Hall in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the Imperial Household Law established in 1889 (Meiji 22), it was stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai ceremony must be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there is no specific provision in the current Imperial Household Law enacted after World War II that the enthronement ceremony must take place in Kyoto. In 1990, during the enthronement of the current Emperor, for the first time in history, the ceremony took place at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor where the symbolic enthronement takes place. The Takamikura is located in the Shishin-den at the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, known as the ""Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishin-den-no-gi""), it was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
"Sugi, kirizuma-tsukuri, hiwadabuki, chūkan ikkan no yon ashi-mon de aru."
"The gate is only opened for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, dignitaries, or foreign guests, as well as for public viewing."
"There are five lines (horizontal lines) in the left and right walls of the Tsukiji wall, and this also shows the highest level of formality as a wall."
"When you enter through this gate and pass through the vermilion-lacquered tiled Seiyo-mon gate, you will see the Shikun-den in front of you."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on the Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Heritage) passed down to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Department.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" which is the opposite of ""secular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency's Music Department, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Music Department excluding Western music."
Many are passed down as court music in instrumental compositions.
It is the world's oldest style of traditional music still performed in large ensemble form today.
"However, as a form of ensemble music, Gagaku had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered descendants of court musicians (Gagaku families) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is doubtful to what extent the form of the Heian period has been inherited."
"It is speculated that the notation written in katakana for the shakuhachi flute maintains the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century when singing as a hymn, with the pronunciation of the ""ha"" row as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo,"" and overall faithfully reproduced."
"Things written in Chinese characters, like the notation of the Raku Biwa, share many similarities with the Biwa notation discovered in Dunhuang, China, and many styles that were transmitted from even older continents have been inherited."
"One of the most important historical documents is the ""Taigen Shou"" written by Toyohara Noriaki (1450-1512) out of concern for the dispersal of records such as Gagaku due to the Onin War."
"Tsunaaki Tsunaki, a member of the Tsuga family, compiled records on gagaku and bugaku with the sho at the center, making it a valuable record on ancient gagaku."
"Ritual music originating from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese Gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music performed at the banquet of the Tang Dynasty called Yan Yue."
"In terms of music categories, various international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lam Ap music (music of Champa) are transmitted, containing elements of ancient Japanese music dating back before the introduction of continental music."
"Before modern times, the Tenoji Gakuso of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Dainai Gakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major music halls that conveyed the oldest styles."
"These music schools were invited to Tokyo in the modern era, forming the basis of the current music department of the Imperial Household Agency, and the traditions of each music school continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influence can be seen between folk songs and shomyo, and a unique Japanese style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of S-style traditional dance songs.
There is a view that only items brought from outside of Japan are considered as gagaku.
"Left dance・Tang music… Chinese, Indian, and Linyi (southern Vietnam) influences"
"Right dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin"
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned styles (Japanese music).
Songs created during the Heian period (Utai mono)
The lyrics refer to a song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances are collectively referred to as traditional Japanese music and theater.
"Emperor Kanmu (737 – April 9, 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan."
Emperor Kanmu was born in the 9th year of Tenpyo (737) as the first son of Prince Shirabe (later Emperor Komyo).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shinno, the mother of Emperor Kanmu, is said to be a descendant of the Baekje royal family, descended from King Munju of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince Yasumaro (later Emperor Heijō), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Otabe (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after the ascension of the White Wall King, who was the father, the mother, Takano Shinkasa, was from the low-ranking immigrant clan, the Wa clan, so the crown prince was not desired. He initially aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat and had served as a chamberlain, head of the university, and middle minister."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan and others, the former Crown Prince and his mother Empress Inoue were suddenly deposed and the younger half-brother was proclaimed Crown Prince on January 2, 773, in the 4th year of the Hoki era."
"In order to avoid the growing influence of the various Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794 Heian-kyo was built again."
"In order to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi, a military force was sent with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the general."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Motozane of the Fujiwara Shikike family for the hardships that such military affairs and construction were causing the peasants."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of cultural aspects.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang and brought new movements to Japanese Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Kanmu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Takechi, and the dark aspect of his reign at the beginning, where his younger brother Prince Sawara was exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu and died in confinement."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19th, 800, Emperor Kanmu posthumously named Prince Sawara as Emperor Sudo, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"While known as the guardians of Saicho and Kukai, on the other hand, they have put pressure on the so-called ""Nanto Rokushu"" factions, such as confiscating their land, due to the existing Buddhist sects having too much power involved in the government."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later incident known as the ""Yao-ko Incident."""
"He passed away on March 17, 806 in the 25th year of Enryaku."
"Japan's Emperor Jimmu was given the posthumous title ""Yamato-neko Amatsuhitsugi Iyade-ri-no-Mikoto"" in the Japanese style."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given the Chinese-style posthumous title."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tenkoku Oshihagi Miya Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashihara Mausoleum in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he had been insistent on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"In the Meiji era, he was enshrined as the first emperor of Heian-kyo at the Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in one of the three main shrines of the Imperial Palace, the Kashikodokoro."
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, in the customary press conference, Akihito made a comment regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is written in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was extensively reported in the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"Some media reports have greatly exaggerated the logic of theories such as ""The imperial family has Korean ancestry"" and ""The theory of the imperial family's Baekje origins."""
"The Otani family (Otani-ke) is the family name of the descendants of Soku E, the son of Kakue Myo and Hino Hirotsun."
"Hino Hirotune was a low-ranking nobleman in Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest (founder) of Hongan-ji, the majority sect of Jodo Shinshu."
"When the custom of using surnames became compulsory during the Meiji period, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo) which split in 1602, took on surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum at the Otani area north gate of Chion-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto, as mentioned later."
"Hongan-ji was considered one of the warlords during the Sengoku period in Japan, as it had power comparable to that of the warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki. It is sometimes referred to with the honorific title ""Hongan-ji Kenyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosaku"" based on the temple's main priest's Dharma name in Jodo Shinshu. However, this is just a convenient form of address, and it does not mean that the family lineage of the Hongan-ji's head priest adopted Hongan-ji as their family name or surname, nor that there was a Hongan-ji clan."
"Kakushinni watched over Shinran as he passed away in 1262, and in 1272, she built a hall in Otani near their home in Higashiyama, Kyoto to enshrine his remains."
"Daishi-do became the Daishi Mausoleum, attracting the respect of Jodo Shinshu followers as a mausoleum of Shinran, and Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was appointed as the caretaker to manage it in his absence."
"However, the Otani Mausoleum later became the subject of a dispute between Kakuei's son Kakunyo and his half-brother, Yuizen, over the position of chief priest, as it gathered followers and donations from various provinces. Kakunyo barely emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the chief priest position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Daishonin Temple."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Hongan-ji temple and advanced the formation of the sect. During the time of the 5th generation Shakujo of the Muromachi period, they expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation Zonjo, the Hongan-ji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious sect since the death of Shinran, the formation of the sect was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji was considered a branch temple of Seirian-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's original family), also served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed, and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina area on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the background of the expansion of the teaching force of Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, and the Honganji religious group in Kaga drove out the guardian Tomogashi family, leading to the emergence of a situation known as the ""country governed by peasants."""
"For about a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century began, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Hongan-ji sect, starting from humble farmers, utilized its organizational power to expand its activities across Japan, reaching even the samurai class such as local samurai and landowners. However, the Yamashina Hongan-ji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532 and was damaged by war. The 10th generation head, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo temple founded by Rennyo in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and established it as Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Kamimachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a key point of river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based at Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shonin Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court to stabilize the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the age of Shōwa, in local Jōdo Shinshū sects such as those in Hokuriku, there were some who were beginning to stray from the control of Higashi Hongan-ji and follow their own path."
"During the reign of the 11th Monshu, Kenju, the Honganji sect had become an independent daimyo power in fact. They expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who was trying to establish unified control by taking away feudal power from religious factions."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple, fortified in Ishiyama, allied with its followers across various regions in resistance against the Oda clan. This collaboration allowed the Honganji Temple to gain the upper hand, greatly troubling Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima Town, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikkō-ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's naval forces, allied with the Honganji Temple, were defeated by the Oda naval forces in the Battle of Kizu River, leading to successive defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its domain."
"While still maintaining strong support from the Iga clan and others, Ishiyama Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among enemies. In 1580, finally succumbing to Nobunaga who obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, Ishiyama Hongan-ji withdrew and its authority as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, Chōshi Kyōnyo and Ken'nyo disagreed over continuing to resist against Ken'nyo's intentions. When Ken'nyo passed away in 1593, his third son Jun'nyo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple began to split over the position of the gatekeeper, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted separate temple grounds to Kyonyo and Junyo, leading to the establishment of the East Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers moved from the group led by Junjo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, to the group led by Kyonyo of Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into two factions."
"Originally, Shinran, the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the heads of the East and West Ootani families, who trace their lineage to Hino Hirotsuna (the father of Kakunyo), have a tradition of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles, and they have continued to intermarry with court nobles for generations, thereby furthering their court noble status through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotanabe City is located in the central part of the triangular area of the three prefectures, touching Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"Kizugawa River flows along the north-south direction on the east side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), and is sandwiched by the Ikoma mountain range on the west side, with the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line passing through the central part."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, the town of Tanabe in Teshigi District was officially incorporated as a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, it was established as the 12th city, the 669th in the country, for the first time in 20 years since the city of Yawata."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was given the prefix ""Kyoto"" and became ""Kyotanabe City,"" and on the same day, the town of Tanabe in Kyoto Prefecture was designated as a city (city system enforcement) and the name of the city was changed to ""Kyoto City Tanabe"" to ""Kyoto City Kyotanabe""."
"In addition, the new city name was selected through a public application process."

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nara-dera Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsui Yamate Station."
"Kintetsu Ninnaji Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe city, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"Additionally, regular subway trains from Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line stop at Kintetsu Nittaiji Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Nishi-Mukōyama Station and Higashi-Mukōyama Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the old province name of Wakayama, ""Kii,"" is included in the station name in Tanabe City to avoid duplication of station names within the jurisdiction of the same West Japan Railway Company."

Musashi Province was once one of the provinces in Japan's regional administrative divisions.
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding the islands and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (the entire area of current Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The status in the Engishiki is classified as provincial governors, provincial ranks, and distant provinces."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in the area that now corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, spanning the districts of Katsuragino and Atagino in Yamashiro Province. It was a capital city that was laid out in a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Establishing the Imperial Palace at the north end of the capital, and setting up the Suzaku Avenue running from there to the center of the city, with the districts of Rakuchu (Left Capital) and Ukyo (Right Capital) on the left and right sides respectively (the eastern side being Rakuchu and the western side being Ukyo)."
"The layout plan is basically a reproduction of Heijo-kyo, following the model of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"However, there were no city walls."
"There is a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Symbols corresponding to Feng Shui, which was transmitted from China."
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the present-day Kyoto city.
"The main road of the northern boundary is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern boundary of Kujo Oji is Kujo Street slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
"The East Border of Tokyo, the maximum road, corresponds to the present Teramachi Street."
The estimated location of Saigen's Saijokyojimichi is a line connecting JR West's Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line's Nishikyogoku Station running north and south.
"In Kyoto, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring approximately 120 meters on each side by major and minor roads running north, south, east, and west."
"Four rows of towns lined up in an east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the north edge) are called ""jo,"" and four rows lined up in a north-south direction are called ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district was assigned a number.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juuyoncho""."
"The width of the road was 4 jo (about 12m) even in small roads, and more than 8 jo (about 24m) in major roads."
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"When it reached Suzaku Avenue, it had a width of 28 jo (about 84m)."
"In addition, the Horikawa-kouji and Nishi-Horikawa-kouji streets had rivers (Horikawa, Nishi-Horikawa) flowing parallel to them."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built the city of Nagaoka-kyo.
It is said that there was an intention to break away from the powerful nobles and temples that supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu in Yamato Province and establish a new capital city for the Emperor Tenchi's lineage.
"However, in 794, just 10 years later, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This re-relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events that led from the assassination of Fujiwara Taneie, which occurred in Nagaoka-kyo, to the demotion of Prince Sawayorin. Additionally, the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo is also considered to have played a role."
"It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo began with the building of the Imperial Palace (Dai-dairi), followed by the development of the city (urban area)."
"However, due to the wetlands formed by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), the area of Ukyo in Kyoto did not undergo urbanization even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had mostly become obsolete, there were cases of land being converted to agriculture in areas that were originally prohibited within the capital."
"The residential area for the nobility was established in the left capital, excluding the northern part of the right capital near the Dai-no-Machi."
"Nihon Koki is an official history book compiled in the early Heian period, and it is the third of the six national histories following Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the seventh year of the Jōwa era (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the eleventh year of the Enryaku era (792) to the tenth year of the Tenchō era (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara no Suketsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the book."
"Due to the deaths of three people excluding the heir, the Emperor Junna later issued an edict commanding Kiyohara no Natsuno, Prince Naotomo, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono no Minsuk, Sakamoto Imotsugu, and Shimada Kiyoda to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further edicts were issued commanding Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsuneyasu, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatoro to carry out their duties."
"Furthermore, they added Kurataka Niwa and Yamada Furu Tsugi, and finally reported the completion on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841)."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who was consistently involved in the project spanning three generations of emperors was Fujiwara no Morotsugu."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text records the reigns of Emperor Heijō, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna during the era of Emperor Kanmu."
"Around the beginning of the 15th century, there were 40 volumes collected, but they were later scattered. Haya Hajimeichi's disciple, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at Sanjo Nishi family (there is also a theory of the edited version by Yagi Hiroaki), and it was published for the first time."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijou), and 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, with the entire reign of Emperor Junna missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text to some extent from excerpts of ""Nihon Kiryaku"" and the classification of the topics in ""Ruijukokushi"" in the excerpts of the six national histories."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Ibun,"" which collect excerpts from various sources, based on which the Shueisha translations and the Kodansha academic library have been published."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Morotada.
"Adding short biographies to the obituaries of the Emperor and court officials, as seen in the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" is consistent with subsequent historical texts."
"However, the obituary in this book does not flow into unilateral and official praise or criticism, but rather includes interesting descriptions with unique critiques and impressions, making it unusual among the histories of the six countries for maintaining a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contained more waka poetry compared to other historical records before and after.
Sei Shonagon (around the 3rd year of the Kocho era (966?) - around the 2nd year of the Manju era (1025?)) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but this is unconfirmed."
"One of the ""Five Women of the Pear Jar,"" she was the daughter of the famous poet Sei Shonagon (908-990) in his later years."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in the ""Gosen Wakashu"" as ""Higaki no Ouna,"" but this is nothing more than a nonsensical theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"Among siblings, there is a woman who became the wife of Gagaku leader Narinari, Dazai Sho Kan Shinishi, Kakenin Denjo Hojo Kaisen, and Fujiwara Rino (the siblings of Fujiwara Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a wife's name, with ""Sei"" taken from the surname of Kiyohara and ""Shonagon"" taken from a family position title."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""The Pillow Book excerpt""), but it is not reliable."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and a collection of 42 poems attributed to her, titled ""Kiyoshikono Naishi-shu"" (though the number of poems varies in different versions, with 31 poems in some), has been handed down."
"In the Kokinshu Collection, following this, 14 poems were included in the Imperial Anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"The father is Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"The mother is the daughter of Norimichi Konoe, Keijuin."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"He was initially a Buddhist monk, but escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other retainers after Nobutaka was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others."
"Supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, he went up to Kyoto and became the 15th shogun."
"Soon, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and, in concert with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, helped to form a coalition to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate was practically destroyed."
"After that, he received assistance from Motonari Mōri and then Hideyoshi Toyotomi and spent his remaining years."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was Ashikaga Yoshiteru, who was the adopted child of his older brother, he became the adopted child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofukuji Icchoin) under the name Kakukei."
"Later, he was promoted to the position of Gonshonin at Kofukuji Temple."
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Miyoshi Three, and others. Additionally, my younger brother, Ashikaga Shunsuke, who was the head priest of the Deer Garden Temple, was also lured and killed."
"At that time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared making enemies of Kofukuji Temple by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of head priest at Kofukuji Temple in the future)."
"However, he was helped to escape by his vassals, Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Yosimasa, and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In the book that describes Yoshiteru, it is mentioned that he was also referred to as the ""Buke Gosho"" and other aliases."
"When he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also known as the ""Poor Magistrate""."
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Jugo-shi and appointed as a Sadaijin."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Gonjitsu's ""Gonjitsu-kyo Ki,"" it is clear that he had already received his appointment before. This is based on the fact that on the day of the appointment of Ashikaga Yoshiteru as shogun, which took place in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), an envoy from Yoshiteru appeared at Gonjitsu's residence, who was the envoy of the appointment, to request mediation for his promotion to Jushi-shita. Gonjitsu was perplexed by this."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki first relied on the father and son Oda Nobukatsu and Oda Nobutaka of Omi Province, but Nobutaka secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Three to defect to the home of his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitsugu in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, in the Wakasa Takeda clan, due to succession struggles and power struggles among senior retainers, they lacked the ability to go up to Kyoto, and in September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking assistance in restoring the shogun's family."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already held the branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate's ""Kuramitsu Palace"" with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, and because he had no intention of actively going up to the capital with Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had just returned to secular life, the journey to the capital did not materialize."
"Yoshikage Asakura serves as the head of the Asakura clan. (There is no official historical record of Yoshiteru undergoing a formal coming-of-age ceremony up to this point, making it unusually late for the time.)"
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, he moved to Mino Province and relied on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court and assumed the position."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Jushi-ijo, Sangi, and Sakonoe no chujo."
The JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto Sen) is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The Keihan Kyoto Main Line runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) for almost the entire route, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line on the Kinki Nippon Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is added to the name."
"The line color is blue (■), and due to its positioning as the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running along the right bank of the Yodo River parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
It is a double-track line in both directions for the entire section (outer track and inner track).
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, J-Thru ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI can be used."
The Hankai Line operation management system is introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that run on the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan-Hanshin Slow Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Additionally, nearly half of the local trains will be extended to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR conversion, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing from Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train to the Sanin area, which began operation with the Chizu Express, began direct operations to Kyoto. The number of express trains on this section has increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running to Kyoto as regular trains a year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto became an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound ""Thunderbird"" express train."
"In addition, the sleeper express trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"Note that the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" from Shin-Osaka to the Osaka Loop Line enter the Hanwa Line at Ibaraki Station (starting from Departure Track 3), then switch to the freight line and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the limited express and new rapid trains running on the outer line take slightly longer travel time than those on the inner line, and there are times when two limited express trains enter at the same time at Shin-Osaka station depending on the time of day."
"The track alignment is very good along almost the entire line from Kyoto to Osaka, and speeds of up to 130km/h are possible on the outer tracks, with the exception of some curved sections."
"The inner track is also compatible with speeds of up to 120 km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for transfers or special trains)."
The following are the limited express trains that run on this section.
"In addition, in relation to the storage and removal at Mukaijima-cho (Kyoto Integrated Operating Center), transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train)"" and ""Tanba (train)"" and ""Hokukei (train)"" are running on this section."
"Also, the transfer train between Mukohara and Osaka of ""Thunderbird"", ""Raitori"", and ""Kitaguni"" travels via the Hokkou Freight Line."
"When storing a train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto General Operations Office, proceed in the down direction from Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter from the west side to the northward freight line, and then merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (use the opposite route when retrieving the train)."
"Therefore, if you are running during storage and retrieval, the front and back of the formation are reversed."
The Shin-Kaisoku service operates directly from JR Kyoto Line via the JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Ako Line from the Harima/Ako direction to the Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line station of Omi-Shiotsu/Obama.
"From daytime to nighttime, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Biwako Line and the remaining three trains continue on the Kosei Line."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12 cars using the JR West Japan 223 series electric trains in the 1000 and 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Motorway is a high-standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100km, starting from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending at Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"Running north to south through the long Kyoto Prefecture, the road strengthens the cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, promotes regional revitalization, and serves as a vulnerable southern outer ring road for the high-standard road network in the Kyoto metropolitan area."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture described this main road as the ""spine of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three locations, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, have been opened, and the starting point side was opened under the name of the Kyoshi Bypass, not the Kyoto Vertical Transit Highway."
"In general, the Kyoto Tamba Road is often referred to as the Kyoto Vertical Highway."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"Please note that the section between Kumiyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed national expressway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage of small vehicles such as mopeds is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5m are not allowed to pass.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only in the toll-free section."
"The Kyotamba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angu-ji, which is scheduled to open in the summer to fall of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At the same time, Ayabe Angu-ji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current free section between Ayabe Angu-ji IC and Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be toll."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Angokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"The current Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, so there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe-Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built in a prefabricated temporary structure.
"The construction of the Tanba IC to Kyotanba Wachi IC is currently in progress by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and is scheduled to open in the 2014 fiscal year, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinazaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatsukake IC to Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road for general use."
"On March 8, 1998: The Ayabe JCT to Maizuru Oe IC section was opened, connecting to the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (provisional two lanes for opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: Privatization of four road-related public corporations resulted in the transfer of ownership to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and the management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections with a ■ as the background color in the IC number field indicate that the road is in service.
"In addition, the part where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicates that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
MUJI has no BS.

"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire Mount Hiei at an elevation of 848 meters."
"The mountain is more often called Mt. Hiei than by its temple name, Enryaku-ji."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"It is the main temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the establishment of Kukai, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and insight), and Pure Land practices were also carried out, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. In the Heian period, it gained great influence and was revered by the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the ritual prayers performed by Esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the Esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple competed with the Esoteric Buddhism of Tendai-ji Temple, known as ""Tai-mitsu""."
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a general term for the three towers and sixteen valleys scattered within the precincts from the top of Mount Hiei to the eastern foothills, such as the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokogawa."
The construction of the hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in by Saicho in the 7th year of Enryaku (788) marked the beginning.
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the era name at its founding, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the passing of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin and Enchin who laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, the founder of the Yuzu Nembutsu sect Ryojin, the founder of Jodo Buddhism Hōnen, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Shinran, the founder of Rinzai Zen Eisai, the founder of Soto Zen Dogen, and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism Nichiren. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the nickname ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous training such as the ""12-year pilgrimage to Mt. Koya"" and the ""1000-day circumambulation of sacred peaks"" has been continued to this day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a sacred mountain for mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyama-Ikazuchi-no-Kami, the landlord deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's common name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766) in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) (there is also a theory that he was born in 767)."
"At the age of 15 in the year 780 (Treasure Year 11), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji Temple and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), he received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a formal monk."
"Young Saicho, for various reasons, chose to seclude himself on Mount Hiei near his hometown rather than seek a stable position at a large temple in Nara, devoting himself to training and studying scriptures day and night."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the various sutras, and he studied the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi (""Mohe Zhiguan,"" ""Maka Shikan,"" and ""Hokke Gengi"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small temple consisting of Yakushi Hall, Monjudo Hall, and a scripture repository at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, and named it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" taken from an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"Emperor Kammu at the time relied on Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close associates, the Hiei Mountain Temple gradually prospered as a dojo for national protection guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802 AD), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas research student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a mission ship."
Saicho studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of Doji and learned Tendai teachings from Dengyo Daishi (Shigi) himself at the sacred site of Mount Hiei.
"In addition, at the Ryukoji Temple in Echizen (Shaoxing), they are learning esoteric Buddhism from Shunkei Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is commonly believed that the moon is deified as a god who rules over the night, but there are also other theories (as mentioned later)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"In the Nihon Shoki, there is a story about killing the Hoakujin, so it is generally considered a male god, but there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon goddess is often depicted as a female deity, and there are also many goddesses with more aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the theory of a female goddess, as it is not conclusive evidence that the story of the killing of Yasukenokami was perpetrated by a male deity."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in the depiction of his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he returned from Yomi and performed purification, and he formed the three noble children along with Amaterasu, who was born from his other eye, and Susano-o, who was born from his nose."
"On the other hand, the Nihon Shoki states that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, and there are also stories that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, with her dominion not limited to the heavens or sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in opposition to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese myth of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Book of History""), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from the sun god Helios, and the identification of the two did not occur until later."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation of the heavens and the earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and the night respectively, and separated light from darkness, telling the story of the creation of the sun and the moon."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally not very active."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the Kojiki, Volume Five, Section Eleven, that the origin of grain is being discussed."
Some theories suggest that balance is maintained between the contrasting personalities of the gods Amaterasu and Susanoo by placing a god who does nothing between them.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationship between the Amatsukamimusubi and Kamimusubi gods, as well as between the Hosuseri and Hoori (Yamatsuhiko) and Hoderi (Umatsuhiko) gods."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
Some people advocate the theory that Susano-o is the same god because their domains and episodes partially overlap.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, it is said that when Izanagi washed his right eye, the three noble children, including Amaterasu and Susano'o, were born."
"Tsukuyomi was ordered to ""inform the Night Food Country,"" but after that, there was no further activity."
There is also a theory that there is a country called Yomi where the goddess Izanami resides.
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, the creation of the moon deity is briefly described as ""giving birth to the moon deity who radiates brilliance second only to the light of the sun, and sending it to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first volume, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto is said to have created Oho-namuchi no Kami by holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and Tsukiyomi no Kami by holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories in which it is said that, along with Amaterasu Omikami, the gods were instructed to rule the heavens in the domain of dominance. On the other hand, there is also a story that they were commanded to govern the eight hundred layers of the tides of the vast ocean (this seems to have originated from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of three gods are running parallel."
"In the fifth paragraph of the Chronicles, it is said that Amaterasu Oomikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to govern the heavens together, but later Tsukuyomi no Mikoto was commanded to descend to meet the god Uke Mochi in the sky."
"In response, the god of food produced rice from his mouth as an offering, but the Moon-Reading Lord became angry and called it ""disgusting."" He then killed the god of food with a sword."
"From the corpse of the food god were born cows, horses, silkworms, rice plants, etc., which became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onmyoji) is one of the official positions that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasasho in ancient Japan under the Ritsuryo system."
"This refers to the position of a practitioner (official) who performs divination and examines the earth's energies based on the philosophy of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. Initially assigned based on this belief system, the role eventually expanded beyond the original legal regulations to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and ritual ceremonies."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who perform divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"Sometimes pronounced as ""on'yoji"" without gemination."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements in ancient China, starting from the Xia dynasty and nearly completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this concept, were transmitted directly from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the year 512 (7th year of Emperor Keitai) when scholars of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje, or by the year 554 (15th year of Emperor Kōtoku) when a diviner arrived."
"Although the initial influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), a figure named Kanroku, who can be considered a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje. Kanroku began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Prince Shotoku, and started to have a significant impact on our country's politics."
"In Japan for the first time, the calendar (Ganko calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, the dispatch of the envoy to Sui, an advanced civilization country, began in 607 (Emperor Suiko 15th year). In addition, the influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"Afterwards, the court continued to send exchange students with the mission to Sui (later with the mission to Tang), and also invited many monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula within China or neighboring areas, in an effort to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has come to be considered important in Japan to predict the future by considering the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and judging fortunes and misfortunes based on the principles of the Five Elements generating and overcoming each other, in order to obtain guidance for all kinds of human affairs. As a strategy for determining fortunes and misfortunes and obtaining a code of conduct, the Yin Yang and Five Elements philosophy has come to be emphasized."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, took a divination stick during the Jinshin War and established the ""Onmyo-ryo"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a department within the Nakatsukasa-sho was officially recognized, and it was stipulated that officials such as astronomer, Onmyoji, calendar expert, and timekeeping expert would be appointed as permanent members. Alongside the Kamiyori-kan, they were responsible for conducting official divinations."
"Those responsible for the technology brought from the continent are typically individuals skilled in that area. Therefore, various doctors and onmyoji are appointed with expertise in Chinese literature and comprehension, predominantly from the Han Dynasty, Later Han Dynasty, Sui Dynasty which succeeded in dominating the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje which held power on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholars who originally came from Silla, a power on the east coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 (Year 2 of the reign of Emperor Tenji), where Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Baekje Dynasty. Many scholars from Baekje came as refugees during that time, and a large number of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo at its establishment focused purely on divination, geomancy (similar to feng shui), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and timekeeping. Therefore, they mainly made predictions based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of yin and yang, rather than performing religious rituals or sorcery like shrine officials or monks. They played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the court, as well as in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyoryo as a system of government officials and the duties of Onmyoji
"In the Onmyo Agency, there is an administrative official who serves as a government official."
"Supervising the Yin-Yang Bureau, overseeing all aspects of astronomy, calendars, weather, and atmospheric phenomena, recording and sealing any abnormalities without leaking to the outside, reporting secretly (astronomical secret report), presenting the calendar for the new year created by the calendar master by November 1 each year (calendar report), and reporting the results of divination and geomancy as necessary."
