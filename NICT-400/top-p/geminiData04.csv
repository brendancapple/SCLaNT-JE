"A Christian Protestant school corporation, descended from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, unlike so-called mission schools, it does not prioritize Christian evangelism (it does not consider education as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."

"For ""Ikkyū-san's Anecdotes of Wit,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-dō"" (this page also has some information). For the television anime ""Ikkyū-san,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"The diary of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Higashibōjō Kazunagakyōki,"" entry for August 1st, Meio 3 (1494), states: ""Secret tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kacu-ro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(Please refer to the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgaishūkan of Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being named Shūken."
"He was gifted with poetic talent from a young age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and took the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Oei era)."
"Iku received the Dharma name ""Ikkyū"" from Haku-sō after answering the koan ""Dōzan's Three Meals of Rice"" with the words, ""From the world of existence to the world of non-existence, returning to rest. If it rains, let it rain. If it blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (煩悩), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (仏)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the cawing of a crow."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
He sent the fool away with a laugh.
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verses, calligraphy, painting, and eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Go-Hachijo for the throne.
"From the ""Chronological Biography of Ikkyū Sōjun, the First Zen Master of the East Sea."""
"However, Shukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyū's recommendation played no role."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. Although he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) due to the Meiji Restoration's relocation of the capital to Tokyo."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but due to wars and other calamities, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Court moved to the Satouchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Satō Inner Palaces, and it was the residence of the emperors of the Jimyōin line, who later became known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present day (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of European castles, some argue that this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity between the common people and their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (king) during the French Revolution, by commoners has not occurred in Japan is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the present-day intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of JR Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo only a decade earlier, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered its preservation and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunego-ten, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa performed their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, the ceremony was held for the first time in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor where he sits during his enthronement, symbolizing his accession, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a plain wooden structure, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special events, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or for public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, a mark of the highest status for a wall."
"Entering this gate and passing through the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term refers to all musical pieces performed by the department, excluding Western music."
Much of it is preserved as instrumental music in court music.
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of Gagaku, it was discontinued for over a hundred years after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been preserved."
"It is speculated that the singing of hichiriki scores written in katakana, which involves singing the musical notation with melodies, faithfully reproduces the pronunciation characteristics of the Japanese language before the 16th century, including the pronunciation of the ""h"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo."""
"The notation used in the Raku Biwa, written in kanji, shares many similarities with the Biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and further suggests the inheritance of an older style from the continent."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakka family compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, which is a valuable record of ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music that originated in China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, the Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, among the repertoire currently performed in Japanese gagaku, is said to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music), are internationally diverse, and the music also contains elements of ancient Japanese music that predate the transmission of music from the continent."
"Before the modern era, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major musical institutions."
"These musical institutions were later called to Tokyo in the modern era, forming the basis of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are inherited by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style song and dance.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) origins."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origins."
These include songs (honkyoku) produced in Japan that imitate the above style.
Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono).
The lyrics refer to a ballad.
"Sometimes, ""Koku-fu Kabuki"" and ""Yōmon"" are collectively referred to as ""Ancient Songs."""
Emperor Kanmu (737 – 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of humble origins, a naturalized clan of the Wa clan. As a result, he was not expected to become crown prince and initially pursued a career as an official, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the Middle Palace."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed. On January 2, 773, he was made Crown Prince."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, Heijo-kyo was built in 784, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built anew."
They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of Conquest to invade the Tohoku region and subdue the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the suffering inflicted upon the peasantry by such military and construction projects."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of culture."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marked by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, as well as the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince. Prince Sawara was banished on charges of being involved in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, casting a dark shadow over the beginning of the reign."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the position of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too powerful through their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"It is also said that the chaos in the imperial palace contributed to the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17, 806."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi-iya-deri-no-Mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku Osse Oboe U Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The tomb is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three shrines within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of discussion in the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making significant leaps in logic."
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji temple, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned below, at the Otani site, north of the Chion-in Temple in eastern Kyoto."
"Although the Hongan-ji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), was considered a force comparable to the warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement, and its head priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Hongan-ji,"" such as ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" and ""Hongan-ji Kosuke,"" this was merely a matter of convenience in addressing them. The Hongan-ji Temple head priest's lineage never adopted ""Hongan-ji"" as their family name or surname, and there was no such thing as a ""Hongan-ji"" clan."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became a revered temple for Jodo Shinshu followers, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, was appointed to manage it as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani Temple, attracting pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the absentee post between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Yuizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee post by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, has been developing its religious organization. During the Muromachi period, the fifth head priest, Shaknyo, expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh head priest, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working to establish their own organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji Temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as a kind of steward for the Kujo family."
"In the late 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its eighth head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province, and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect of Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, established by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), which became known as Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the summit of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a key point for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo secured the temple's power base by forging close ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some members of the Honganji sect in regions such as Hokuriku began to pursue their own independent paths, breaking away from the control of the Honganji temple."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and seeking to establish unified rule by seizing territorial power from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand. This was due to the combined efforts of Kannon, who fortified himself in the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the Honganji followers who resisted the Oda clan throughout the land. This alliance greatly troubled Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, suppressing resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own territory."
"Despite maintaining its strength by gathering support from groups like the Saika, Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to abandon Ishiyama Hongan-ji. With this, Hongan-ji's power as a territorial lord ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point, the Honganji Temple began to split over the issue of the head priest's position. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the Higashi Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyo'nyo."
"At this time, many followers left Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, and joined Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to a split between the two temples."
"Both the Eastern and Western Ootani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a long-standing tradition of adopting sons from powerful court nobles. They also maintained a tradition of intermarriage with court nobles, further solidifying their connection to the court through their maternal lineage."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It sits at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, flowing north-south on the east side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are heavily characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city nationwide."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment) with the addition of ""Kyo"" from ""Kyoto"" in the name. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is thriving, with Gyokuro as a specialty product."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"Bus depot relocation on May 10, 2008."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamajiro-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Adjacent Itecho, Tsuzuki District is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the time of its municipal incorporation.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While the Kii Tanabe Station (Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the inclusion of ""Kii,"" the former province name of Wakayama, in the station's name is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces of the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama Prefecture, the eastern region of Tokyo excluding the Sumida River and islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, provincial governor rank classification, remote province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a walled city built on the border of the two counties of Kadono and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing the city into Sakyo (east) and Ukyo (west)."
"The floor plan essentially follows the layout of Heijō-kyō, while emulating the style of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony"" (Sishin Souou), derived from Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyo area was smaller than present-day Kyoto City.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Southern Limit of the Ninth Avenue is currently the Kujo Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Grand Avenue corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the Nishikyogoku-Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""条"", and a group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
"Roads, even narrow lanes, were at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) wide, while major roads were over 8 zhang (about 24 meters) wide."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters).
"Also, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi-horikawa River) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to establish a new capital under the reign of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Emperor Tenmu lineage was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyō."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), so it remained undeveloped until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely a formality, the capital was so desolate that farmland, which was originally forbidden within its boundaries, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"Noble residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records a period of 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the year 819, Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three others, excluding Otsugu, died with the task unfinished, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Naoe-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, entrusting the execution to Fujiwara no Tsugushi, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Shikatori."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and藤原緒嗣 was the only one who worked on the project throughout the three generations of emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued,"" this work records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the collection was scattered by the early 15th century. It was rediscovered by Inayama Gyokyo, a student of Handa  Hokiichi, in the Sanjo-nishi family, who found 10 volumes in manuscript form (though some argue it was discovered in a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu). This rediscovery led to the first publication of the work."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories,"" and the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" a categorized compilation of the ""Six National Histories,"" by referencing their citations."
"There are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsumon"" which are collections of anecdotes from various places, and based on these, the following are published by Shueisha's Annotated Japanese Historical Materials and Kodansha Academic Library."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinions of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of including short biographies (kōden) in death notices for emperors and court officials, following the precedent of the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the biography in this book does not fall into the usual one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and observations, making it a unique work among the Six National Histories for its persistence in critical thinking."
It is also known that the Rikkokushi included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical texts.
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in the ""Goshūi Wakashū"" as ""Higaki no Ōna,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are siblings, including the Head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice, and the priest Kaishu of the Flower Mountain Palace, as well as a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name, a lady-in-waiting, is said to be derived from her family name, Kiyohara, and the title of a relative, ""Shonagon."""
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, such as the ""Makura no Soshi"" (Pillow Book), suggest it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is not reliable."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collection of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most common version has 31) has been passed down."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keishu-in, daughter of Konoe Nobutada."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He had initially been a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"He then ascended to the throne as the 15th Shogun, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle him."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga Shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending its reign."
He then spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537, the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji) as the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Yoshitaka, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple's abbot in the future, so they confined him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and attacked by night thieves, and was even called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jushi no ge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed to the post of Sama no kami (Master of the Horse)."
"However, while there are doubts about the exact date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's messenger came to his residence to request mediation for his promotion to Jushi no ge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son, Takeda Yoshitaka in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at his side, and he had no intention of actively going to Kyoto with Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had recently returned to secular life, so the trip to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there are no historical records of Yoshiaki having formally come of age at this point, making his coming of age extremely late for the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Councillor and Middle General of the Left Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodo River's right bank, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
It is a four-track line with four tracks in each direction (outer and inner tracks).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line also serves as a route for rapid, express, and local trains connecting JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and San'in regions."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically as sleeper express trains to Kyushu that had originated in Shin-Osaka, limited express trains to the Kii Peninsula that had originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began operation with the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all began making direct runs to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later. The New Osaka - Kyoto line became a corridor of express trains, with four or so departures per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, as part of the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line depart from the third platform at Ibaraki Station, enter the freight line, and then enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains that run on the outer tracks on the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, allowing for 130 km/h operation on the outer tracks except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling 120 km/h trains, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, freight trains for ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" trains run on this section for entry and exit to Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Furthermore, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains, when running as empty trains between Mukomachi and Osaka, use the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka line, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, when running in and out of the depot, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Amagasaki and Kamigori on the Sanyo Line, and Banshu-Akō on the Akō Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Omi-Shiotsu Station on the Hokuriku Line, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to evening, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one daytime service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
All trains operate with 8 or 12 cars using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100 km from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City in the same prefecture, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478)."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, it strengthens the connection between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, revitalizes the region, and serves as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the ending point. The starting point opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc., is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section, Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll gate will be established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. This eliminates all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Route 9 Old Nozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Ooe IC (provisional two-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei, at an elevation of 848 meters, as its grounds."
"While it is officially known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei, or simply Eizan, is a more common name."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The Chief Priest (or Abbot) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongobuji Temple."
"Besides the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, it also practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and the chanting of Buddha's name, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained the respect of the Imperial family and nobility, wielding significant influence."
"In particular, esoteric rituals and prayers gained the support of the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple, belonging to the Shingon sect, was called ""To-mitsu,"" while the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Dai-mitsu,"" and the two competed for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective term for the temples and pagodas scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and other structures within the three pagodas and sixteen valleys."
It began in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which took the era name of its founding, was only granted in 824, fourteen years after Saicho's death, during the Jōnin era."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, leading to the temple being called the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training such as ""12 years of mountain seclusion"" and ""1,000 days of mountain circumambulation"" continues to this day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times.  The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, chose not to seek a secure position in the great temples of Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, near his hometown, devoting himself to training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Words of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the era name, was granted only after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the Jōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national defense center, protecting Kyoto from evil spirits in the northeast."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a gengakushō, a short-term overseas student."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804 AD.
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dosui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyoman."
"Furthermore, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from Shunkyo Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing)."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, there are alternative interpretations (discussed later)."
"The name is also read as ""Tsukiyomi."""
"While the Kojiki contains a story of the slaying of the food deity, Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the text itself does not contain any descriptions that definitively determine its gender."
"Many moon deities in other cultures are goddesses, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and they support the theory that the deity was a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi, while considered the god of the moon, has varying accounts of his divinity depending on the source."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" presents a different account, stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The extent of her dominion also varies, encompassing heaven, the sea, and other undefined realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, is a concept found in various mythologies, as comparative mythology points out."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the sun and moon origin myth, a common motif found worldwide, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears relatively infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall role is rather limited."
"Only in the fifth section, eleventh book of the ""Nihon Shoki"" is there a brief mention of the origin of grains."
"There is also a theory that this balances out by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, who have contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in the relationship between Amenominakanushi no Kami and Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and in the relationship between Hosuseri and Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [the other deity] are the same god, as their domains and some of their stories overlap."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, she was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""announce the food of the night,"" but he has no further exploits after this."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo section simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose brilliance rivaled the sun's, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the first book of the Kojiki states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While there are several stories where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, there are also accounts where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tides of the vast ocean."" This latter story seems to stem from the belief that the moon controls the tides, and multiple accounts of the birth of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth section of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Ukemochi, the Food Goddess, in the heavens. He descended and went to Ukemochi."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as a gesture of hospitality, vomited rice from her mouth, and Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto, angered by this, killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the Grain Deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to grains."
"Onmyōji, a title for an official in the Ministry of Central Affairs' Onmyōryō department during the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system."
"The official position, originally assigned to practitioners of divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, later expanded beyond the original legal framework to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and ritual."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sound of ""n"" being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are constituted by combinations of these principles. This philosophy, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendrical systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping, was transmitted to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 CE (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when I Ching scholars arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little impact on politics and culture, in 602, Kanroku, considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, on these subjects, significantly influencing the nation's governance."
"The first adoption of a calendar (Genka calendar) as the official calendar in Japan, along with the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign) to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendrical methods, marked the beginning of a period where the influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought was strongly reflected in the promulgation of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the establishment of the twelve-rank cap system."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the envoys stopped, to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to judge good fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the Five Elements (五行) theory of mutual generation and overcoming, thereby predicting the future and obtaining guidance for all aspects of life."" As a result, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of determining auspiciousness and misfortune, and establishing behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination and deeply versed in the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, even using divination by the ""shi"" during the Jinshin War, established the ""Onmyōryō"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the growing influence of Yin-Yang and Five Elements thought. In 718, the Yōrō Code officially established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Yin-Yang masters, calendar experts, and clock experts. This officially recognized the practice of divination alongside the divination by tortoise shell conducted by the Shinto priests."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as doctors and Onmyoji, and they were all immigrants who were well-versed in various disciplines and proficient in reading classical Chinese. These included scholars who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui (which replaced them as the dominant power on the mainland), Goguryeo and Baekje (which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula), and occasionally Silla (which initially held power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula)."
"Particularly, following the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent reinforcements to Baekje, its close ally, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed.  In the period before and after this event, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje arrived in Japan as refugees, many of whom were appointed to government positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Office's expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern-day Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the use of clepsydras.  Therefore, their role was primarily confined to astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on the Yin Yang Five Elements.  They did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial Court, and in determining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and directions, which proved vital during relocation of the capital."
