"The Doshisha Educational Corporation, which includes Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College."
"Doshisha is a comprehensive educational institution founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, a Christian Protestant (Congregationalist), and based on Christian principles. It comprises nine educational institutions, from university to kindergarten, all bearing the name ""Doshisha"" (as of April 2005)."
"Approximately 36,000 students are currently enrolled at Doshisha as of April 2004."
"Currently, Doshisha University holds an <AA+> rating from Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating in a 21-level system.
"It is among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Jirō Niijima envisioned the cultivation of individuals who could ""apply their conscience to their skills"" as the purpose of his educational institution."
"Our hope is to cultivate individuals with ""conscience permeating their whole being"" by pursuing ""moral education"" based on Christianity alongside knowledge education, ensuring a balanced approach."
"Monuments bearing his thoughts, inscribed in his own handwriting, stand at various institutions, including Doshisha University."
"This monument to conscience bears the inscription, ""May men arise whose conscience fills their whole being."""
"Furthermore, to realize this ""conscience"" education concretely, educational philosophies of ""Christianity,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" are espoused, aiming to cultivate individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation"" through these principles."
"A Christian Protestant school corporation, following the tradition of Congregational churches (union churches)."
"However, it differs in nature from what are known as mission-oriented universities, as it does not prioritize Christian evangelism (education is not used as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor was Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jōshīma Jō, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded Doshisha English School in Kyoto's Teramachi-dori Marutamachi."
Moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa in 1876.
Doshisha Branch School for Women was established in April 1877 and renamed Doshisha Girls' School in September.
"1883, Doshisha established its rules."
Announcement of the establishment of Doshisha University was published in major newspapers and magazines nationwide in 1888.
"In 1896, the Ordinary School was renamed Doshisha Senior High School."
Established Doshisha Elementary School.
"1897, M.F. Denton founded Demachi Kindergarten."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"For ""One-Hundred-and-One Stories of Ikkyū"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū Dō"" (some information is also included on this page). For the TV anime ""Ikkyū-san"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"The diary entry of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Higashibōjō Kazunaga Kyōki,"" dated August 1st, Meio 3 (1494), states: ""Secretly transmitted tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuang Yunzi, Kua Lu, and Meng Gui."
"The Buddhist name is Soshun, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(Please refer to the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgaishūkan of Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being named Zhou Jian."
"He displayed exceptional poetic talent at an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass,"" composed at 13, and ""Spring Clothes Dwelling in Flowers,"" written at 15, gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively determined if it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of Kaso Sodan, a high priest of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, in 1415 (Oei 22)."
"Ikyu received the Dharma name ""Ikyu"" from Kaso after answering the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Rice"" with, ""From the realm of existence to the realm of non-existence, return. Take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If it blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (煩悩), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (仏)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the cawing of a crow."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away with laughter, calling him a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verse, calligraphy, and painting, marked by eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono, from the Fushimi-no-miya family, was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hachijo.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Sōjō, the Most Renowned Monk of the East Sea."""
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the shogunate's approval and that Ikkū's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. Although he did not reside at the temple, he dedicated himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, the Inner Palace, was located near the center of the city, but it fell into disrepair due to wars and other disasters, leading to its relocation to the Satouchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of these provincial palaces, and was the residence of the emperors of the Northern Court, later known as the Jimyoin lineage."
"The imperial palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance is by application only, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the 21st century, is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the nearby Imadegawa Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"The Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Dairi and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto residents often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of European castles, some argue that this reflects a different level of familiarity between the common people and their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that there has never been an incident in Japan similar to the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (king) during the French Revolution, is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The Imperial Palace at the time of the founding of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a location northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the West Japan Railway's Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo just a decade earlier, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokamonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa held their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specifically designate Kyoto as the location for the enthronement ceremony. In 1990, when the present Emperor ascended the throne, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time in the Tokyo Imperial Palace."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne symbolizing the Emperor's accession and where the Emperor sits during the enthronement ceremony, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a plain wood, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a column spacing of one ken."
"The gate is only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or for public events."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, a mark of the highest formality for a wall."
"Entering this gate and passing through the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
"This paper focuses on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property), particularly those preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency, the term ""court music"" refers to all music performed by the department except Western music."
It is largely inherited as court music in the form of instrumental pieces.
It is the oldest musical style in the world to be still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form, Gagaku was discontinued for over a century after the Ōnin War, until the Tokugawa shogunate brought together descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been preserved."
"It is inferred that the performance, including the pronunciation of ""ha"" sounds as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo,"" characteristic of pre-16th century Japanese, and the overall faithful reproduction, accurately conveys the musical notation written in katakana for the hichiriki."
"The notation used in the music of the *Raku Biwa* shares many similarities with the *pipa* scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and it appears to preserve many elements of an older, continental style."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of gagaku (court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakusha family compiled records of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, which are valuable documents about gagaku in ancient times."
"It is derived from ritual music that came from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, the Tang music, said to have been transmitted from China, that is currently performed in Japanese Gagaku, is said to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"Even as musical categories, names reflecting international diversity like Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin-yi music (Champa music) are known, suggesting the presence of elements from ancient Japanese music predating the transmission of music from the continent."
"Prior to the modern era, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Ouchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major musical centers."
"These musical ensembles were later called to Tokyo in the modern era, forming the basis of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department. However, the traditions of each ensemble continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, creating a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are being passed down by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style Kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only definition of gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) origins."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin."
These include songs produced in Japan (Honkyoku) that imitate the above style.
Songs created in the Heian period (utaimono)
The lyrics refer to a ballad.
"Ancient Japanese songs sometimes encompass both ""Kokufu Kabuki"" and ""Yōmon."""
Emperor Kanmu (737 – 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano's new hat was descended from the Baekje royal family, tracing their lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu produced Prince Ando (later Emperor Heizei) and Prince Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinryo, was of humble origin, a naturalized clan of the Wa family.  Therefore, he was not expected to become crown prince and initially aimed for a career as an official, serving as a Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of the Center."
"However, he was suddenly made Crown Prince on January 2, 773, after his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were deposed in a political struggle involving the Fujiwara clan."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Heian-kyō was built in 794, after the construction of Nagaoka-kyō in 784."
They also sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of Conquest to invade the Tohoku region and subdue the Emishi.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the military and construction projects that were burdening the peasantry."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of culture."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new momentum to Buddhism in Japan."
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Taga, and was also marred by the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince, after he was falsely accused of the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's grave was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the rank of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had gained significant power through their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"It was also said that the chaos in the imperial palace was a contributing factor to the later ""Incident of Yakushi,"" creating a breeding ground for it."
"Passed away on March 17, 806 (Year 25 of the Enryaku era)."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi Ya-derino-mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku Ossebari Mikami Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian-jingu as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in a portion of his remarks regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea because the *Nihon Shoki* records that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of conversation in the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making significant leaps in logic."
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hiromitsu was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hōshū) of the Hongan-ji temple, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Honbyo), which separated in 1602, adopted surnames."
The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum in the Otani area north of the Chion-in Temple in eastern Kyoto.
"Although Honganji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), wielded power comparable to that of warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement, and is sometimes counted among the warlords, and its head priest's dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honganji"" as in ""Honganji Kannon"" and ""Honganji Kosa,"" this is purely for convenience of appellation. The head priest lineage of Honganji Temple never adopted ""Honganji"" as their family name or surname, nor did a clan named ""Honganji"" ever exist."
"Jaku Shinni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to enshrine his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"The Otani Hall, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became the Otani Temple, revered by followers of Jodo Shinshu, and its management was entrusted to Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, as the caretaker."
"However, the Ōtani temple, due to the influx of pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the position of absentee abbot arise between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Yuizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee abbot by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, proceeded to form a religious organization. During the Muromachi period, under the fifth head priest, Shaknyo, it expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh head priest, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working to establish their own organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji temple was significantly delayed. During the early Muromachi period, the Honganji temple was considered a branch temple of the Shoren-in temple, and the Otani family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's family), were said to have served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of the 8th abbot, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the abbot to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province and then to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect of Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For about a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest,  Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), which had been established by Rennyo, and it became known as Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located at the top of a hill on the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic hub for river transportation at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shōnyo forged close relationships with various lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court, solidifying the temple's power base."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some members of the Honganji Buddhist sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central control of the Honganji and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, advanced into the Kinai region and clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to unify the region by seizing territorial power from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand. This was due to the combined efforts of Kannon, who fortified himself in the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the Honganji followers who staged resistance movements against the Oda clan throughout the land. This significantly challenged Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, among other local resistances being quelled. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats outside the Honganji Temple."
"While Hongan-ji Temple continued to maintain its strength with the support of groups like the Saika-shu, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. Finally, in 1580, it yielded to Nobunaga, who had secured an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and evacuated Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple. With this, Hongan-ji Temple as a territorial power ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point onward, the Honganji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of its head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, creating the Higashi Honganji Temple, distinct from the original Honganji Temple led by Kyo-nyo."
"At this time, many followers from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyojo's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in the division of the Honganji into east and west."
"Both the Eastern and Western Otani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a long-standing tradition of adopting sons from powerful court nobles. They also maintained a consistent pattern of intermarriage with court families, further solidifying their courtly lineage through their maternal lines."
"Kyotanabe City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, near the border with Osaka and Nara Prefectures."
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It is situated at the center of the triangular region of the three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, which flows north-south along the city's eastern side, and the Ikoma Mountains to the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are strongly characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city nationwide."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment) with the addition of ""Kyo"" from ""Kyoto"" in its name. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
It is renowned for its thriving tea (Uji tea) cultivation and produces exceptional Gyokuro.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (began operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city

"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keishin East Rose Town."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the same time the city was incorporated.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii,"" the old province name of Wakayama, in the station name located in Tanabe City is likely to avoid name duplication within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."

Musashi Province was one of the provinces of Japan under the Ritsuryo system.
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama Prefecture, the eastern region of Tokyo excluding the Sumida River and islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki: Provincial Governor Rank Classification, Remote Province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central area of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a walled city built on the border of Kazuragi and Atago counties in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was to be located at the north end center of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city, leading to the left and right capitals (the east side being the Left Capital and the west side being the Right Capital)."
"The floor plan essentially follows the Heijo-kyo model, emulating the Sui and Tang dynasty Chang'an."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony,"" derived from Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyō area was smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is currently the Kujō Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's main road corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Saigyo-ku Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Saikyo-ku Station in a north-south direction.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (about 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south, east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east-west, excluding the two on the northern edge, is called a ""条"". Four rows of towns aligned north-south are called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called something like ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho."""
"The width of the roads was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for narrow lanes, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for major roads."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
It reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters) at Suzaku Avenue.
"Moreover, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishi Horikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that this move was intended to establish a new capital under the lineage of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the lineage of Emperor Tenmu was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyo."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent deposition of Prince Sayo, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo."
The construction of Heian-kyō is thought to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"The right bank of Kyoto, being a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), remained undeveloped even in the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely a formality, the capital was so dilapidated that land within its boundaries was even being converted to farmland, something strictly forbidden."
"Aristocratic residences were established in the Left Capital, except for the northern part of the Right Capital, which was located near the Imperial Palace."
"Nihon Koki is a historical chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the Six National Histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
"Edited by Fujiwara Tsuguo, et al."
"According to the preface, in the tenth year of the弘仁 era (819 AD), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryosen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three others, excluding Otsugu, died before the task was completed, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsu no, Nao-yo-o, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further imperial edict was issued, entrusting the task to Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Katori."
"Later, adding Furukani and Yamada, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation, spanning 21 years, was a project that藤原緒嗣 alone devoted himself to throughout the reigns of three emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" it records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally a 40-volume set, it was scattered by the early 15th century. It was rediscovered in a 10-volume manuscript by Inayama Gyokyo, a student of  Hanawa Hokiichi, at the Sanjo-nishi family (alternatively, it is said to have been discovered in a corrected edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu), and was first published."
"The extant volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the *Nihonki Ryaku*, an abridged version of the *Six National Histories*, and the *Ruiju Kokushi*, a categorized compilation of the *Six National Histories*, by citing passages from both."
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes from various sources, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun,"" which have led to the publication of the following works by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
The content is said to most reflect the views of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of attaching short biographies (kōden) to death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent of the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, this book's account of the Emperor's death does not simply follow the one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather includes many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, making it a unique work in the Six National Histories for its persistence of a critical spirit."
It is also known that the Six National Histories included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical works.
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old legend that identifies the mother of [name] as the ""檜垣嫗"" (Higaki no Ōna) mentioned in the ""後撰和歌集"" (Goshūi Wakashū), but this is nothing more than an absurd and unfounded claim."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Ki no Fusayoshi, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are sisters, the wife of the head of the Gagaku, Tameharu, the wife of the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice, a priestess at the Flower Mountain Palace, Kaishū, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name is a court title, ""Sei"" being taken from the surname Kiyohara, and ""Shonagon"" from a relative's official position."
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, like the ""Makura no Sōshi Shō,"" claim it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is unreliable."
"Counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she is known for her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collection of Sei Shonagon"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most widely circulated version contains 31)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, the daughter of Konoe Nobutada."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his full brother."
"He had originally been a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other court officials."
"And, he ascended to Kyoto under the protection of Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and became the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle Nobunaga."
"Though they briefly cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively marking its end."
He later spent his remaining years with the assistance of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537, the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Having a brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, as heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji) as a ward of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Three Miyoshi Lords. His younger brother, Ashikaga Yoshikazu, who was the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple's abbot in the future, and therefore confined him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiaki."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho""."
"He was driven from Kyoto and was said to have been attacked by night thieves, and was also called the ""poor shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Jushi no ge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and the post of Sama no kami (Master of the Horse)."
"While there are doubts about the exact date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the declaration of Ashikaga Yoshihide as shogun in February 1568, Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when a messenger from Yoshiaki arrived at his residence requesting his mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi no ge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had been appointed before this date."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province. However, Yoshiharu secretly conspired with the Three Miyoshi, and in August Yoshitsugu fled to Wakasa Province to his sister's son, Takeda Yoshitaka."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage, who already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, at ""Kuradani Gosho,"" had no intention of actively ascending to Kyoto with the newly secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the ascent to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of the crown-giving ceremony was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there are no historical records of Yoshiaki having formally come of age at this point, making his coming-of-age ceremony extremely late by the standards of the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province seeking the patronage of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, supported by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Councillor and Middle General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway for almost its entire length, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the name ""JR"" is used as an alias to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and it is positioned as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, so the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes (maximum speed 130 km/h), running along the right bank of the Yodo River, parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line, covering 42.8 km."
It is a double-double track with separate directions for each double track (outer track and inner track).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line uses the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates as an integrated service with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"It also serves special express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region, in addition to local trains, rapid trains, and express trains that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically, with the introduction of overnight express trains to Kyushu that originated in Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula that originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began operating with the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all extending their routes to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation simultaneously with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later. The Shin-Osaka to Kyoto route became a ""expressway"" with about four express trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and others."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, as part of a timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" entering the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line depart from the third platform at Ibaraki Station, enter the freight line, and proceed through the Suita Signal Box to reach Shin-Osaka."
"Therefore, the journey takes slightly longer than express or rapid trains that run on the outer lines of the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may arrive at Shin-Osaka Station simultaneously."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, allowing for 130 km/h operation on the outer tracks, except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling 120 km/h trains, but express trains never use it (except for empty trains or special trains)."
The express trains operating on this section are as follows.
"In addition, there are empty trains, such as the ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki,"" that run on this section for entry and exit to and from Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains running between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Hokubu Freight Line during their deadhead runs."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka line, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west, and then merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed when it is running in and out of the station."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Line Amagasaki, Kamigori, and Ako Line Banshu-Ako to JR Kyoto Line, then to Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to night, there are trains every 15 minutes, with one daytime service going to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains operate using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, with 8 or 12 cars."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway (Kyoto Jukan Expressway) is a 100km long high-standard expressway (National Route 478) starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It traverses the long north-south expanse of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening the connection between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, revitalizing the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a fragile high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture calls this road ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the ending point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway""."
"Also, it is often the case that the Kyoto-Tanba Road is referred to as the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and driving with a small special vehicle is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Angokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer to autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At the same time, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, leading to the toll collection of the currently free Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita-Honsen toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll plaza will be established."
"The current Ayabe Angokuji IC does not have a toll booth. As a result, there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway."
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyoto-Tanba Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an opening scheduled for fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Onozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, while the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Kutsugaki IC to Chiyogawa IC is reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyo River IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) via the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Oe IC (provisional 2-lane, opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is not yet complete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the schedule number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, with its grounds covering the entire Mount Hiei, which stands at an elevation of 848 meters."
"More often called Mount Hiei, or Eizan, than by its formal name, Enryaku-ji Temple."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"The head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The head priest (chief abbot) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, it also practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Nembutsu, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. It gained great influence during the Heian period, receiving the patronage of the Imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, esoteric rituals and prayers gained the support of the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple (Shingon sect) competed with the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, which was known as ""Taimitsu."""
"Enryaku-ji is a collective term for the various halls and pagodas of the three towers and sixteen valleys, scattered throughout the grounds from the summit of Mount Hiei to its eastern foothills, including the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokawa."
Its origin lies in the establishment of a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in by Saicho in 788 AD.
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the era name of its founding, was not permitted until 824, the fourteenth year of the弘仁 era, after the death of Saicho."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen Buddhism, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen Buddhism, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the title of ""The Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training such as ""12-year hermitage"" and ""1,000-day mountain pilgrimage"" continues to this day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, a mountain whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a site of mountain worship since ancient times. The Hie Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, is dedicated to Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (some sources say 767)."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained (became a monk) under the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji temple and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, becoming a fully ordained monk."
"Young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, chose not to pursue a secure position at a major temple in Nara. Instead, he secluded himself on Mount Hiei, near his hometown, devoting himself to rigorous training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho, believing the Lotus Sutra to be the pinnacle of all scriptures, devoted himself to the study of the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", ""The Words of the Lotus Sutra"", and ""The Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the present location of the Konponchudo, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the era name, was granted only after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the Jōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devout follower of Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national defense stronghold against evil spirits, guarding the north-east, Kyoto's ""oni-mon"" (demon gate)."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a Gensekusho, a short-term overseas student."
"In 804, he traveled to Tang Dynasty on a Japanese embassy ship."
"Saicho went to the sacred Mount Hiei, where he studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Moreover, he studied esoteric Buddhism from Ajari Junkyo at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing) and Zen from Zen Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, alternative theories exist (discussed later)."
The name is also read as Tsukiyomi.
"While the Kojiki contains a story of the slaying of the food deity, Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the text itself does not contain any descriptions that definitively determine its gender."
"Many lunar deities in other cultures are goddesses, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the killing of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and they support the theory of a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, fleeing from the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" presents a contrasting account to the ""Kojiki,"" stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. Furthermore, her domain is inconsistent, ranging from the heavens to the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in a complementary relationship with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, has a similar concept in various myths, as pointed out in the field of comparative mythology."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same only occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, it is told that on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and appointed them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the worldwide myth of the sun and moon being born as a pair, a common motif in creation stories."
"Despite being considered a significant deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi has a limited presence in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall activities are rather sparse."
"Only briefly, in the fifth section, eleventh chapter of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" is there mention of the origin of grains."
"There is also a theory that this is balanced by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, who have contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in other pairs, such as Amenominakanushi to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri to Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some believe that Susanoo is the same deity as [another deity], as their domains and stories overlap in some aspects."
"Born from the washing of Izanagi's right eye, they are known as the ""Three Noble Children"" alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, as recorded in the first volume of the Kojiki."
"Tsukiyomi is ordered to ""inform the Land of Food of the night,"" but there is no record of his further actions."
There is also a theory that Izanami is in the Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo-ki simply states that the deity of the moon, radiating a brilliance second only to the sun's light, was born and sent to heaven to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Ōhirume no Mikoto, and holding another white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukoyomi no Mikoto."
"While there are several stories where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside another deity, there are also tales where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" seemingly stemming from the belief that the moon controls the tides. This results in multiple parallel accounts of the birth of the three deities."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth scroll, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi on earth. He descended and went to Uke Mochi."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, in an act of hospitality, offered food from her mouth, which angered Tsukiyomi no Mikoto, who considered it ""unclean"" and killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the goddess of food, oxen, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, which became the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji, a title for an official in the Ministry of Central Affairs' Onmyōryō during ancient Japan's Ritsuryō system."
"A technical position (official) assigned to perform divination and geomancy based on the principles of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, later expanding beyond the original legal regulations to oversee all aspects of divination, sorcery, and ritual practices."
"Since the medieval period, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practice divination, sorcery, and rituals in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'youji"" without the sound of ""n"" being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are formed by combinations of these principles. Closely related disciplines such as astronomy, calendrical systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping were introduced to Japan directly from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 CE (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when a Five Classics scholar arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when an I Ching scholar arrived."
"Although the initial impact of these studies on politics and culture was minimal, the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko's reign), considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, marked a significant turning point. Kanroku lectured these studies to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, leading to a profound influence on the nation's governance."
"The first adoption of a calendar (Genka calendar) as the official calendar in Japan, along with the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign) to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendar systems, marked a significant turning point.  The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought is evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility."
"Thereafter, the court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (and later Tang) dynasties, and also invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the envoys often stopped, in order to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became crucial to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to judge auspiciousness, misfortune, and good or bad fortune based on the principles of the Five Elements (五行) theory of mutual generation and overcoming, thereby predicting the future and obtaining guidance for all matters of human affairs.""  This led to the emphasis on Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory as a means to determine auspiciousness and misfortune, and to obtain guidelines for behavior."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomy and divination who was so skilled in the art of Tenmon Tonkou that he personally used a shi (a divination tool) during the Jinshin War and was deeply knowledgeable in the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, established the Yin-Yang Office and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyoji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating a growing influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought. In 718, the Yoro Code formally established the Onmyo-ryo, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Yin-Yang scholars, Onmyoji, calendar experts, and clepsydra experts. This officially recognized the practice of divination alongside the divination of the Shinto priests."
"Only those skilled in techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as specialists, and these positions were filled by immigrants proficient in various disciplines and skilled in reading classical Chinese. These individuals typically came from the former Han Dynasty, the later Han Dynasty, the Sui Dynasty which replaced them as the dominant power on the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally from Silla, which initially controlled the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Especially after the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed. In the aftermath, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje arrived in Japan as refugees, and many of them were appointed to government positions."
"In its early days, the Yin-Yang Office's techniques were purely focused on divination, geomancy (similar to modern-day ""feng shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and clepsydra. It solely predicted events based on theoretical analysis using the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, without engaging in religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, it played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial Court, and by divining the auspiciousness of land and directions, it proved vital during relocations of the capital."
