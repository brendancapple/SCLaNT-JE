The Doshisha Corporation (English: The Doshisha) is the educational corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College are affiliated.
"Doshisha was founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima as a Christian Protestant (Congregational) school based on Christian principles, and is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational facilities bearing the name ""Doshisha"" from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 people are studying at Doshisha University."
"Currently, Doshisha Educational Corporation has obtained <AA+> from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating in a 21-step rating scale.
"Alongside Waseda University and Keio University, it is one of the top school corporations."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience"" based on Christian spirit."
Shinshichi Kato aimed to foster individuals who would utilize their conscience in their actions as the purpose of education.
"I wanted to produce people who are ""filled with conscience throughout their bodies"" by promoting ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel with knowledge education, so as not to be biased towards knowledge education."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting expressing those thoughts can be found at various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May this monument be a symbol of the strong spirit filled with conscience."" are engraved on this monument."
"Furthermore, in order to concretely realize this ""education of conscience,"" education principles of ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these values."
It is a Protestant school corporation with roots in the Congregationalist tradition.
"However, it is different in nature from so-called mission-oriented universities and does not have as its primary purpose the Christian mission (does not use education itself as a means of mission)."
"A school corporation that originated from Doshisha English School, founded by Shuji Isawa, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era in 1875."

"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara Nagamasa, ""Record of Lord Tohojo Nagamasa,"" on the first day of August in the third year of Meio (1494), it is written, ""It is said in secret that the monk Ikkyu is a royal son of the Emperor Go-Komatsu."""
"""There is no one in the world who knows it."""
"According to later historical records, his childhood name was Chigikumaru."
"He was later called Zhou Jian, and went by the aliases of Kuang Yunzi, Xialu, and Mukei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shujun, also written as Shunjun."
Ikkyu is a dharma name.
"Please refer to the ""Posthumous Buddhist Names"" section for information on posthumous names and dharma names."
"At the age of 6, he entered the Ankokuzan Hōkō-ji in Kyoto and received the precepts, and was named Shūken."
"From an early age, he showed great talent in poetry. His Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass,"" written at the age of 13, and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Among Flowers,"" written at the age of 15, were highly praised and acclaimed in the capital city of Luoyang."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Soi and changed his name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's behavior is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of the Ōei era (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a high priest at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto."
"He received the nickname ""Ikkyu"" from Hoso, for answering the koan ""The stick of Dongshan's three pounds"" with the verse: ""Returning from no-being to being, take a rest; if it rains, let it rain; if the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Arroji (world of defilements)"" refers to the world of delusion (kleshas), while ""muroji (world of enlightenment)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in the 27th year of Ōei (1420), upon hearing the cawing of a crow, I suddenly had a great realization."
"The old man tried to give Ikkyu a letter of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"It is said that the old man sent him off with a laugh, calling him a fool."
"In the future, I lived a life of poetry, mad songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Shōkō passed away without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and ascended to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the East Sea""."
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Kameyama was supported by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era following the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the head priest of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, the 47th head priest. Although he did not reside in the temple, he made great efforts in its revival."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho) is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo procession of the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and it was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it was also called the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to the Rikyu Palace due to wars and other factors."
"The Togu Palace of the Tsuchimikado Tokoin was one of the palaces in this village, where the imperial family of the Jomyo-in line, later known as the Northern Court, resided."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be called the Southern Court, was located within the Nijo Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the original Tsuchimikado Higashidōin Dairi, but rather an expansion based on the Tsuchimikado Higashidōin Dairi."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the imperial procession to Tokyo in the second year of Meiji (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property classified as ""Imperial property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north is Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both located on Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Residents of Kyoto often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace as ""Gosho."""
"There is a theory that the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high unlike overseas castles, reflecting the difference in the sense of closeness between the common people and rulers (emperors and imperial family members) in the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This is one of the reasons why such incidents have not occurred in Japan."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a position northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the JR Nijo Station in Kyoto."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the Imperial Family, called the Tsuchimikado Higashidono, and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of the Genko era (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period (six of which were due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855) in the Heian style, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its old appearance."
"Main buildings include Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den Hall in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the Imperial Household Law established in 1889 (Meiji 22), it was stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai ceremony should be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there is no specific provision in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II regarding the location where the enthronement ceremony should take place, such as in Kyoto. In 1990, during the enthronement of the current Emperor, for the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing the enthronement, which is located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokuirei-Seiden-no-Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishin-den-no-Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"Sugi, kirizuma-tsukuri, hiwada-buki, hashira-aida ikken no shikyakumon de aru."
"The gate is opened only for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, important guests, or public tours."
"On both sides of the Tsuijibei wall, there are five lines (horizontal lines) running across, which also indicate the highest level of formality as a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the red-painted tiled roof of the Shoumei Gate, you will see the front of the Shikun-den."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on Japanese gagaku music (Important Intangible Cultural Asset) passed down to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Department.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, excluding Western music."
Many are inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the world's oldest style of traditional music still performed in large ensemble form today.
"However, as a traditional form of ensemble music, it had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of court musicians (gakka) and reorganized it, so it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been inherited."
"When singing the score written in katakana for the biwa, it is speculated that the pronunciation of the Ha-row is pronounced as fa fi fu fe fo, faithfully reproducing the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century, when singing as a chant (chanting the melody in a low voice with the musical notation)."
"Things written in kanji, like the notation for the lute, share many similarities with the lute scores found in Dunhuang, China, and further inherit many styles that were passed down from an even older continent."
"One of the most important historical documents is the ""Taigen Shō"" (Compilation of Musical Sources) written by Toyohara Tsuneaki (1450-1512) out of concern for the dispersal of records such as gagaku due to the Ōnin War."
"""Tsuneaki, the head of the Shakuhachi family, compiled records on Gagaku and Bugaku centered around the shakuhachi, making it a valuable record of ancient Gagaku."""
"The music for rituals that was transmitted from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century is the basis."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the songs currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music played at a banquet called Yan music in the Tang Dynasty."
"In terms of music categories, there are various international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linyi music (music of Champa), reflecting the rich diversity of influences. Japanese traditional music elements from before the introduction of continental music are also included."
"Before modern times, the Tennoji Gakuso at Shitennoji Temple in Osaka, the Dainai Gakuso at the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, and the Nanto Gakuso at Kasuga Shrine in Nara were considered the three major Gakuso institutions that preserved the oldest styles."
"These musical institutions were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each musical institution continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences can be seen between folk songs and shomyo, and Japan's unique style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency's Music Department."
Please refer to the lyrics of the S-style song and dance.
Things that were brought from outside Japan (some consider only these as gagaku).
"Left-side dance, Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Linyi (Southern Vietnam) influences."
"Right dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin"
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned style (Japanese music).
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period
The lyrics refer to a song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances in the Japanese style are collectively referred to as ancient songs.
Emperor Kanmu (737–806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shin no Kasuga, the mother, is a descendant of the Baekje royal family, with King Munju as her ancestor."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince Yasukado (later Emperor Heijō), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Hakuba, ascended to the throne, Prince Takano Shinkasa was not desired to be the Crown Prince because his mother was from the low-ranking immigrant clan of the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the center."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and the younger half-brother was made Crown Prince on January 2, 773, in the 4th year of the Hoki era."
"In order to avoid the increasing influence of the Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built again."
"To conquer the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi, a military force was sent with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the commander."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing suffering to the peasants with such military and construction projects."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new developments to Japanese Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Kammu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Hoo, as well as the dark side of exiling and causing the death of Prince Sawara in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu at the beginning of his reign, are also part of his reign."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Kanmu posthumously honored Prince Sawara as Emperor Sudo, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, while existing Buddhism had too much power involved in the government, they put pressure on various sects known as the ""Nanto Rokushu"" by confiscating their estates."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident at Yaxi,"" becoming a breeding ground for it."
"He passed away on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Emperor Jimmu, who was given the posthumous name of Yamato Takeru Ihare no Mikoto and the Japanese-style posthumous title."
"Along with that, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given the Chinese-style posthumous title."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tenkoku Oshihara no Mikoto Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he was insistent on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"In the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
All emperors are enshrined in one of the three Imperial Mausoleums at the Imperial Palace.
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, during the customary press conference, Emperor Akihito made a statement regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was widely reported in the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"Some reports have greatly exaggerated the logic of theories such as ""The Imperial Family has Korean ancestry"" and ""The Imperial Family is of Baekje origin."""
"The Otani family (Otanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest of the Jodo Shinshu sect's main temple, Honganji."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo), which split in 1602, took on surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, at the Otani site north of the main gate of Chion-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Hongan-ji was counted as one of the daimyos of the Warring States period in Japan, as it had the power to rival the daimyos under the spread of the Ikko Ikki movement. It is common to refer to the head priest with the honorific title ""Hongan-ji Kenyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosaku,"" but this is purely for convenience and does not mean that the family lineage of the head priest made Hongan-ji their family name or surname, nor that there was a family called Hongan-ji."
"Kakushin-ni watched over Shinran's deathbed in 1262, and in 1272, she built a hall to enshrine his remains in Ohtani near her home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Daishido in Otani became a mausoleum of Shinran as Otani Mausoleum, gathering the reverence of Jodo Shinshu followers, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, was appointed as the caretaker to manage it."
"However, the Ohtani mausoleum later became a source of conflict between the disciples of various provinces due to the gathering of pilgrimages and donations. This led to a dispute over the position of the head priest between Kakuei's son Kakunyo and Kakuei's half-brother Yuizen, with Kakunyo ultimately emerging victorious and establishing the hereditary succession of the head priest position within his own family lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Honganji Temple and advanced the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation Jakkunyo in the Muromachi period, the Honganji sect had expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation Sonnyo, the Honganji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious organization since the death of Shinran, the formation of the organization was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a sub-temple of Seiren-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's birth family), also served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, caused the Honganji sect to spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of the teachings of Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Tomogashi family by the Honganji sect in Kaga, resulting in the emergence of a situation known as the ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from humble farmers, utilized its organizational strength to expand its activities throughout Japan, reaching the warrior class such as samurais and local lords. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke no Ran in 1532, and the 10th head, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinaru-gun, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), renaming it Ishiyama Honganji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located on the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodogawa River was dominated by Osaka.
"Using the Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his base, Shonin worked to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of the Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the late Edo period, in local Jodo Shinshu sects such as those in Hokuriku, there were individuals who were beginning to deviate from the control of Honganji and follow their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head priest, Kenyo, of the Jodo Shinshu sect, the Honganji religious organization, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away feudal lord power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan, which lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple, fortified in Ishiyama, collaborating with its followers who resisted the Oda clan in various regions. This collaboration allowed the Honganji Temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own domain."
"Despite maintaining strong influence by gathering support from the Iga clan and others, Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The power of Hongan-ji as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, the eldest son Kyonyo and Kenyo, who advocated continuing to resist against Kenyo's intentions, had a falling out. When Kenyo passed away in 1593, his third son Junyo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Honnō-ji began to walk the path of division over the position of the head of the gate, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu separated the Higashi Hongan-ji by giving Kyoju a separate temple ground from Junjo."
"At this time, many followers moved from the Jodo sect led by Junjo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, to the sect led by Kyonyo of Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into East and West."
"Shinran, originally the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the head of the Eastern and Western Tani families, who descended from Hino Hirotsun (father of Kakunyo), were traditionally adopted as sons by powerful court nobles, and also continued to intermarry with court nobles for generations, leading to the advancement of their status through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo-tanabe City is located in the central part of the tri-prefectural triangle area, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows north and south along the eastern side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while the western side is sandwiched by the Ikoma Mountain Range. The central part is crossed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe Town in Tsukigata District was incorporated as a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was established for the first time in 20 years, as the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District was renamed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the prefix ""Kyoto"" to become ""Kyotanabe City"", and the city's name change to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" was implemented on the same day."
The new city name was selected through a general public offering.

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintoku Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyamate Station."
"Kintetsu Shindenba Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, regular subway trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line also stop at Kintetsu Nintoku Station."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishi-Mukonoso Station and Higashi-Mukonoso Station.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the use of the old province name of Wakayama, ""Kii,"" in the name of the station in Tanabe City is to avoid duplication of station names within the jurisdiction of the same West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyoto-Tanabe Sales Office is located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Sales Office is located in the city)"
Musashi Province (Musashi no kuni) was one of the provinces of Japan that was once a local administrative division.
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in the current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (the entire area of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is the provincial governor, provincial class division, and distant provinces."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in the area that now corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanning both Katsura District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province. It was a capital city laid out in a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Establish the Imperial Palace at the northern central part of the capital, and from there, create the Suzaku Avenue leading to the center of the city, with the districts of Sakyo on the left and Ukyo on the right (the east side being Sakyo and the west side being Ukyo)."
"The layout plan is basically based on Heijokyo, following the example of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"However, there were no city walls."
There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to Feng Shui transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost major road is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern limit of Kujo Oji is Kujo Street slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
The eastern boundary of the Eastern Capital is now equivalent to Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Saigen's Saijo Ojiro is a line connecting JR West Japan's Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Railway's Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station north and south.
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 jo (about 120m) on each side, with main roads and small streets running in all directions."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district had a number assigned to them.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juu Yoncho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 jo (about 12m) even in small roads, and 8 jo (about 24m) or more in main roads."
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the intersection of Suzaku Avenue, there was a width of 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, there were rivers (Horikawa, Nishihorikawa) flowing parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built the city of Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu lineage in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi lineage."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"It is believed that this relocation of the capital was influenced by a series of events from the assassination of Fujiwara Tane-tsugu in Nagaoka-kyo to the demotion of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the building of the Imperial Palace (Daijokyu), followed by the construction of the city (urban area)."
"However, due to the fact that the area of Ukyo is a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), urbanization did not progress even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become obsolete, there were cases of land being converted to agricultural use, even though it was prohibited within the capital."
"The residential area for the nobility was established in the left capital, excluding the northern part of the right capital near the Daini-ri."
"The Nihon Koki is an imperial anthology compiled in the early Heian period, serving as the third of the Six National Histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
The editors are Fujiwara no Tsugutsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Three people, excluding the unfinished succession, died, so Emperor Junna later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Prince Naoyuki, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minomori, Sakamoto Imotsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyo, further edicts were issued ordering Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsunemoto, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asakano Shitadori to carry out their duties."
"Furthermore, after adding Furutakaniwa and Yamada Furuji, it was finally reported that the construction was completed on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841)."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Morotomo."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text continues from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign, detailing the reigns of Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna."
"In the early 15th century, all 40 volumes were collected, but they were later scattered. It was not until the disciple of Hanabusa Ikkei, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family (there is also a theory of the revised edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu) that it was first published."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), and there is a complete lack of volumes for the reign of Emperor Junna."
"It is possible to partially reconstruct the text from the excerpt version of the six national histories, ""Nihonki Ryaku,"" and the classification of the six national histories, ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" through quotations."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"" which collect various excerpts from different places, based on which the following Shueisha translation notes on Japanese historical materials and the Kodansha Academic Bunko have been published."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Michitsugu.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Nihon Shoki"" and is the same as other subsequent historical books."
"However, the obituary of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, making it unique in the Rikkokushi for maintaining a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical records.
Sei Shonagon (around the third year of Kocho era (966?) - around the second year of Manju era (1025?)) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"One of the ""Five Men of the Pear Jar,"" she was the daughter of the renowned poet Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990) in his later years."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a wild and baseless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become wives of their brothers and sisters, such as Gagaku Head Seisei, Dazai Shokan, Kaisei, and Hanayama-in Denjo Hoshi, as well as a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara Rinoh (the brother of Fujiwara Michitune's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a court title, with ""Sei"" taken from the surname of her father, Kiyohara, and ""Shonagon"" taken from a court position held by her relatives."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Shou""), but it is not trustworthy."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection ""Kiyoshonagonshu"" consists of 42 poems (the number of poems varies in different versions, with 31 poems in some)."
"The ""Goshui Wakashu"" contains 14 poems selected for an imperial anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father is the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"The mother is Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"He was originally a monk, but after Nobutaka was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he received assistance from Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals and escaped from Kyoto."
He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and ascended to the position of the 15th shogun.
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and, in concert with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, formed a coalition to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate effectively perished."
"After that, he spent his remaining years with the support of Motonari Mōri and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was Ashikaga Yoshiteru, who was the legitimate child of my older brother, I became the adopted child of my maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofukuji Ichijo-in), taking the name Kakukei."
He later advanced to the position of Gon-shonin in Kofuku-ji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Sanbonmatsu, and my younger brother, Ashikaga Shuson, who was the head of the Rokuonji Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of head priest of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they kept him imprisoned.)"
"However, with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Yosimasa, he managed to escape and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In books that describe Yoshiaki, it is noted that he was also referred to by other names such as the Warrior's Palace."
"When he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also known as the ""Poor Governor""."
"On April 21st, he was quietly promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Left Cavalry Captain."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Genkitsu's ""Genkitsu Kyōki"", it is clear that he had already received the appointment before the day of the appointment to Ashikaga Yoshihide, a rival of Yoshiteru, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), when the envoy of the appointment, Genkitsu, appeared at the residence of Yoshiteru's envoy to request mediation for promotion to Jushi-shita."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki initially relied on the father and son Oda Nobukatsu and Oda Nobuyoshi in Omi Province, but Nobuyoshi secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Three to defect to the domain of Takeda Yoshitsugu, his sister's husband in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have enough power to go up to the capital due to struggles for succession and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already had the ""Kuritani Gosho"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and Ashikaga Tsugutomo, along with the newly secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, did not have the intention of actively going up to Kyoto, so the journey to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of the kanmuri was held by Asakura Yoshikage (Note: There is no official historical record that Yoshiteru had undergone genpuku up to this point, making it a very late genpuku for the time)."
"Eventually, he moved to Mino Province, relying on Oda Nobunaga with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was enthroned by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Jushi-i-no-jo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and appointed as Sangi (Councilor) and Left Guard Middle Captain."
The JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion as the Keihan Main Line runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) operated by Hankyu Railway for almost the entire route, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line operated by Kintetsu Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and because it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
"It is a double-track line in both directions for the entire section (outer track, inner track)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-Through ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operating management system has been introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that run through the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan Hanshin Kanko Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Furthermore, nearly half of the local trains will continue on to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR conversion, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuho"" train to the San'in region that started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express, now began to run directly to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, began running all trains to Kyoto on a regular basis one year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound Limited Express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were completely discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that pass through the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka and enter the Hanwa Line enter the freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the limited express and new rapid trains running on the outer track may take slightly longer than the same section, and there may be times when two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time depending on the time of day."
"The track alignment is extremely good along almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line, allowing speeds of up to 130km/h on the outer tracks, with the exception of some curved sections."
"The inner track is also compatible with speeds of up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for transfer and special trains)."
The limited express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, there are transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train),"" ""Tanba (train),"" and ""Hokukinki (train)"" running on this section in relation to the storage and retrieval at Mukaijima-cho (Kyoto Integrated Operating Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohara and Osaka on the ""Thunderbird"" and ""Raicho"" services travels via the Hokufu Freight Line."
"When storing a train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto Integrated Operation Center, proceed in the direction of Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
Shin-Kaisoku runs directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Ako/Akaho Line from Bizen-Ako direction to JR Kyoto Line via Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station to Tsuruga.
"From daytime to night, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Kosei Line and the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12 cars using JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 1000 series and JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100km, starting from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"It runs through the long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road of the Kyoto City metropolitan area, which has a vulnerable high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three locations - the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side - are open, with the starting point side operating under the name of the Keiji Bypass rather than the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the term ""Kyoto Vertical Highway"" is often used to refer specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"The section between Kyo-Miyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed expressway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage such as mopeds is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5 meters are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to only drive on the toll-free section."
"The Kyoto Tanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open around the summer to fall of 2008, is planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current toll-free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also planned to be tolled."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"Currently, Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, which means there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is constructed in a way that is close to a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyo-Tanba Wachi IC section is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The general national highway No. 9 Oinohill Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the general national highway No. 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a temporarily free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatagake IC to Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC begins operation as a toll road for general use."
"March 8, 1998: Connection between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru Oe IC opened, connecting Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (temporary two lanes for opposing traffic)."
"On October 1, 2005: Due to the privatization of the four road-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and management was transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The section with a ■ background color in the IC number field indicates a section where the road is already in use.
"In addition, the part where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicates that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that has not been opened is provisional.
MUJI has no BS.
（数字）is the number of another route.
<Number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire Mount Hiei with an elevation of 848 meters."
"Rather than being called by the name of Enryaku-ji, it is often referred to as Mt. Hiei, or simply Hiei."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"This is the head temple of the Tendai sect in Japan, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai seat master (tendaizasu) and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the establishment of Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and insight), and nenbutsu were also practiced, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great power and received the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the ritual prayers conducted by esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple, known as ""Daimitsu,"" competed for supremacy against the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple, known as ""Tomitsu"" in the Shingon sect."
"The ""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the three towers and sixteen valleys scattered in the precincts from the eastern foot of Mt. Hiei to the mountain top."
"In the seventh year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, which was the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" taken from the era name at its founding, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks and laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism with Ennin, Enchin, the founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect Ryojin, the founder of Jodo Buddhism Honen, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Shinran, the founder of Rinzai Zen Eisai, the founder of Soto Zen Dogen, and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism Nichiren, among others. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the nickname ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and the ""1000-day Pilgrimage to Peaks"" have been continued to the present day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name appears in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyama Ibuki is enshrined as the landlord god of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the year 780 (the 11th year of the Hōki era), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), he received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a formal monk."
"Young Eisai, for personal reasons, chose not to seek a stable position at a major temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself in Mount Hiei near his hometown, dedicating himself to training and studying scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the numerous scriptures, and he studied the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi (""Hokke Gengi,"" ""Hokke Monju,"" and ""Maka Shikan"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, Monju Hall, and Sutra Repository at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, and named it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Konin era (824)."
"During the reign of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho received the emperor's support and the assistance of the influential Waki clan, allowing Mount Hiei to prosper as a dojo for national protection, guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of the Enryaku era (802), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas research student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a ship as part of a diplomatic mission."
Enchin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of Doji and received teachings from the Tendai school from the abbot Gyomanza.
"In addition, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is generally believed that the moon is deified and is considered a god who rules over the night, but there are also alternative theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Nihon Shoki about killing the Hojutsu Kami, so it is generally considered a male god, but there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and there are also many goddesses with aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the goddess theory, as it is not conclusive that the story of Yasoshima's murder must involve a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he returned from Yomi and performed a purification ritual, and together with Amaterasu, born from his other eye, and Susanoo, born from his nose, they became the three noble children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there is a story that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and another story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, with her dominion not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born as a pair with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Book of History""), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also depicted as twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later times that the two were identified with each other."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to govern the day and night respectively, and to separate light from darkness. This is the creation of the sun and moon as described in the Bible."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally not very active."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the ""Nihon Shoki"" Volume 5, Chapter 11, that the origin of grains is discussed."
There is also a theory that balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationship between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, as well as between Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Umisachi-hiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some argue that Susano'o and Susanoo are the same deity due to overlapping domains and episodes.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he was born when the right eye of Izanagi was washed, and he is called one of the ""three precious children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi is ordered to ""inform the Night Food Country,"" but there is no further activity."
There is also a theory that there is a country called Yomi where the goddess Izanami resides.
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, the Age of the Gods, it is briefly mentioned that the moon deity, who shines with a radiance second only to the sun, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, in the following first book, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto gave birth to Obito no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and to Tsukiyumi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu, as well as a story about being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tides of the vast sea plain (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), with multiple stories of the birth of the three gods running parallel."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu-Omikami and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was commanded to descend from the heavens to meet with the god of food, Ukemochi, by Amaterasu."
"In response, the god of food and agriculture spat out rice as an offering, but Tsukuyomi no Mikoto was disgusted and angry, so he killed the god of food and agriculture with a sword."
"From the dead body of the god of food, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions belonging to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasasho under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the position of a practitioner (technician) who performs divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and is later assigned to oversee divination, sorcery, and all aspects of rituals beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who practice divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times it is defined as a type of clergy who perform private prayers and divination in private."
"Sometimes pronounced as ""onyoji"" without linking sounds."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were transmitted directly from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the year 512 when scholars of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje during the reign of Emperor Keitai, or by the year 554 when a divination scholar arrived during the reign of Emperor Kinmei."
"Initially, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), Ganroku, who can be called a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats including Prince Shotoku, greatly influencing our country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Gankyo calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, an envoy was sent to Sui, an advanced civilization country, in 607 (15th year of Empress Suiko). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"Afterwards, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the Sui Dynasty (later with the Tang Dynasty), and also invited numerous monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula or from mainland China or port cities to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has come to be considered important in Japan to predict the future by considering the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and judging good and bad fortune based on the principles of the Five Elements generating and overcoming each other, in order to obtain guidance for all kinds of human affairs. As a strategy to determine good and bad fortune and obtain guidelines for action norms, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy has come to be emphasized."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, took a divination rod during the Jinshin War and established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first observatory in 676 (4th year of Emperor Tenmu)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasa-sho was officially recognized, with the appointment of permanent officials such as astronomers, Onmyoji, calendar experts, and timekeeping experts. Alongside the Kiboku of the Jingi-kan, they were responsible for conducting official divination ceremonies."
"Those responsible for the technology that came from the continent, as well as various scholars and onmyoji, are appointed with expertise in reading Chinese texts and knowledge in various fields. They are mainly scholars who have come from the Chinese mainland, which was ruled by the Former Han, Later Han, and then the Sui dynasty, as well as Goguryeo and Baekje, which held power on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholars who initially came from Silla, which had power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of the reign of Emperor Tenji), where Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Baekje dynasty. Many scholars from Baekje sought refuge and immigrated, with a large number of them being appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo when it was established were purely divination, feng shui (similar to what is now called ""geomancy""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the management of the calendar. Therefore, they mainly predicted astronomical observations, managed the calendar, and judged the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of Yin and Yang, without performing any religious rituals or sorcery like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court, as well as in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyoryo as a system of government officials and the duties of Onmyoji.
"In the Onmyo Agency, there is an administrative official known as an administrative officer."
