"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"The diary entry for August 1st, Meio 3 (1494) in Sugawara Kazunaga's ""Higashibōjō Kazunaga Kyōki"" states: ""According to secret tradition, Ikkyū Zenji was the son of Emperor Go-Komatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kaltro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshun, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgai Shūkan at Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being given the name Shūken."
"He showed exceptional poetic talent at an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ou Soui and changed his Dharma name to Soujun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated that it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of Kaso Sodon, a high priest of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Ōei era)."
"Upon being presented with the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Staff,"" Ikkyu responded, ""From the realm of existence to the realm of non-existence, returning, a moment's rest. If it rains, let it rain; if the wind blows, let it blow."" This response earned him the Dharma name ""Ikkyu"" from the master Haku-so."
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (klesha), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in the year 1420, hearing the crow's cry, he suddenly attained enlightenment."
"Hasso intended to give Ikkyu a certificate of authorization, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, humorous poetry, calligraphy, and painting, marked by eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died childless, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Go-Hōjō for the throne.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Zenji of the Eastern Sea""."
"However, Imazumi Sukuo argues that the enthronement of Emperor Gokasho was the result of the shogunate's approval, and Ikkyu's recommendation played no role."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the 47th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. While he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Imperial Palace in Tokyo (former Edo Castle) was preserved in 1877, following the Emperor's move to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace since the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but it fell into ruin due to wars and other events, leading to a relocation to the Satouchi-no-ri Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of these provincial palaces, and was the residence of the emperors of the Jimyōin line, who later became known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji-kei Imperial line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located in the Nijō Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor moved to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present day (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imoudekawacho Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imoudekawacho campus)."
"The Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Dairi, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the surrounding Kyoto Gyoen National Garden."
"Kyoto citizens often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, as ""Gosho""."
"Although the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of overseas castles, there is a theory that this reflects the difference in the level of familiarity that commoners had with their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial family) in the East and the West."
"For example, the fact that an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (the king) during the French Revolution, by commoners has never occurred in Japan is one of the grounds for this consideration."
"The Imperial Palace at the time of the founding of Heian-kyo was located considerably west of the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of JR Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six of which were due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in 1855, during the Ansei era, in the Heian style, and is known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved the Imperial Palace to Tokyo just a decade prior, he lamented the state of the dilapidated Kyoto Imperial Palace and ordered its preservation and restoration to its former glory."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegotem, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai be held in Kyoto.  Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specifically stipulate the location as Kyoto, and in 1990, when the present Emperor ascended the throne, the enthronement ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor where he sits during his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and therefore was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Soden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi"")."
"A four-legged gate with plain wood, gable roof, cypress bark shingles, and a span of one ken."
"The gate is only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality for a wall."
"Beyond this gate, passing through the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon gate, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
"This paper focuses on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property), primarily as it is passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term ""court music"" refers to all music performed by the Department, excluding Western music."
"Much of it is preserved as court music, primarily in instrumental works."
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of gagaku, it was discontinued for over a hundred years after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of musicians (gakka) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form is still preserved."
"It is speculated that the rendition, sung as ""shōga"" (a method of memorizing melodies by singing the musical notation with rhythm), faithfully reproduces the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century, including the pronunciation of the ""ha"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo"" in the hiragana notation for the hichiriki."
"The notation used in the Rakubiwa resembles the pipa notation found in Dunhuang, China, sharing many similarities and suggesting the inheritance of ancient continental styles."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of Gagaku (court music) due to the Ōnin War."
"The Tōshū of the Shōgakusha, compiled by Tōshū, is a record of gagaku and bugaku centered around the shō, a valuable record of gagaku from an earlier period."
"It is derived from ritual music that came from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, Gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, which is said to have originated in China and is currently played in Japanese gagaku, is believed to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music), reflect its international character, while also incorporating elements of ancient Japanese music that predate the transmission of music from the continent."
"Before modern times, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major musical centers."
"These musical ensembles, known as ""gakuso"" in the modern era, were brought to Tokyo and became the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's musical department. However, the traditions of each gakuso continue in their respective regions."
"It also shows mutual influences from folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-style Kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true form of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... China, India, Lin Yi (South Vietnam)"
"Right Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeastern China) origin."
"These include songs (honkyoku) made in Japan, imitating the above style."
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period.
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, ""Kokufu Kabuki"" and ""Yōkyoku"" are collectively referred to as ""Ancient Japanese Songs."""
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The Continuation of the Nihon Shoki records that Mother Takano Shinryo was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her ancestry back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu produced Prince Atsuno (later Emperor Heizei) and Prince Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of low-born, naturalized descent from the Wa clan.  Therefore, he was not expected to become crown prince and initially sought advancement as an official, serving as a Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political struggles involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed, and he was made Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Heian-kyo was established in 794, after the construction of Nagaoka-kyo in 784."
"They then sent an army under Sakanoe no Tamuramaro, the Great General of the Conquest, to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the military and construction projects that were burdening the peasantry."
He is said to have initiated the compilation of the Chronicles of Japan.
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marked by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, as well as the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's younger brother and designated Crown Prince, who was accused by Fujiwara no Tane継 of assassination."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th of the 19th year of the Enryaku era (800 AD), Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's grave was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and her position as Empress was restored."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara"" by confiscating their estates, as they had become too powerful and involved in politics."
"It is also said that the disorder in the Imperial Palace contributed to the later ""Yakushi no Hen"" (Yakushi's Rebellion)."
"Passed away on March 17, 806 (Year 25 of the Enryaku era)."
He was given the Japanese posthumous name Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi Ya-derino-mikoto.
"Along with that, he was posthumously honored as Emperor Kanmu."
"He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor, and Tenkoku Osuburi no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor."
"The tomb is said to be located at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian-jingu as the first Emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three shrines within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, prior to his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his customary press conference, remarked that he felt a connection with the Republic of Korea, citing the ""Nihon Shoki"" record that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it became a major news story and sparked discussion in Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the theory of the Baekje origins of the Imperial Family, making significant leaps in logic."
"The Ōtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakkei, son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect of Buddhism, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoju) of the Honzanji temple, the largest branch of the sect."
"Both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Honbyo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji era."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the location of Shinran's mausoleum, which was established at Otani in the north gate of Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Honnō-ji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), was a force to be reckoned with, comparable to the warlords, due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement. It is often counted as one of the Sengoku Daimyo, and the temple's head priest's dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honnō-ji,"" such as ""Honnō-ji Kannon"" and ""Honnō-ji Kosuke."" However, this is purely for convenience of reference. The lineage of Honnō-ji's head priests never adopted ""Honnō-ji"" as their family name, nor did a family named ""Honnō-ji"" ever exist."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's Eastern Hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, the temple of Ootani, became the grand mausoleum of Shinran, revered by the followers of Jodo Shinshu, and its management was entrusted to Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, as its caretaker."
"However, the Ohtani temple, due to the pilgrimage and donations of devotees from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the absentee position between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and his half-brother, Yuisen. Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary nature of the absentee position for his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, marking the birth of the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Honganji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, advanced in forming a religious sect. During the Muromachi period, under the fifth generation, Shakujo, the sect expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh generation, Jonyo, the Honganji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been actively establishing their organizations since Shinran's death, the formation of the Honganji temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in temple, and the Otani family is said to have served as a steward to the Kujo family through their connection to the Hino family, Shinran's family."
"In the late 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of the 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising took place in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect of Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by farmers."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was virtually ruled by the Ikko sect."
"Entering the 16th century, amid the turbulent Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, then relocated to the Ishiyama Go-bo, founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as Ishiyama Honganji."
Shihon-ji Temple was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic point for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo forged close ties with various lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court, solidifying the temple's power base."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some members of the Honganji Buddhist sect in the Hokuriku region and other areas began to deviate from the central control of the Honganji temple and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kannon, the Hongan-ji Buddhist sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and attempting to establish unified rule by seizing lordship from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand due to the combined efforts of Kannon and his followers who fortified themselves in Ishiyama Honganji Temple and the widespread resistance movement against the Oda clan by Honganji followers. This greatly troubled Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, which had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed. Resistance was suppressed in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, suffered a naval defeat at the Battle of Kizu River against the Oda navy. The Honganji Temple faced repeated defeats outside its own territory."
"Despite continuing to garner support from groups like the Saika Ikki, Honganji Temple remained strong. However, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. Finally, in 1580, it succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to abandon Ishiyama Honganji Temple. This marked the end of Honganji Temple's power as a feudal lord."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, advocated continuing resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, the Honganji Temple began to split over the issue of the head priest's seat. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, creating the Higashi Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyo-nyo."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to a split in the Honganji Temple into East and West factions."
"Both the Eastern and Western Otani family heads, descended from Shinran, originally a son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a tradition of being adopted by powerful court nobles. They also have a long history of intermarriage with court nobles, leading to further integration into the court noble class through their maternal lineage."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, situated at the center of the triangular area where the three prefectures meet."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, flowing north-south on the east side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains to the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are primarily bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), city status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city nationwide."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment) with the prefix ""Kyo"" from Kyoto Prefecture. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Furthermore, the new city name was chosen through a public competition."
It is renowned for its tea (Uji tea) cultivation and produces prized Gyokuro.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamaki-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Adjacent Itecho, Tsuzuki-gun is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The seated statue of Zen Master Ikkyu and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyoutanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyoutanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city's name around the same time the city was established.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"Although there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii,"" the old province name of Wakayama, in the station name of a station located in Tanabe City is likely to avoid duplication with other station names within the jurisdiction of West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot located within the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, with Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot located within the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces of the Ritsuryo system."
"It corresponds to the area that combines the region east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama and Tokyo prefectures, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, Kokuji Kokutōkyū Bun, Enkoku."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanned across the districts of Kadono and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city, measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city from it, dividing the city into Sakyo and Ukyo (east being Sakyo and west being Ukyo)."
"The floor plan essentially follows the layout of Heijō-kyō, drawing inspiration from Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the concept of ""Sishin Souou"" (Four Gods Harmony), a geomancy principle originating from China."
Heian-kyō was smaller than present-day Kyoto.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is currently the Kujō Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
"The Tokyo Gokudai Road, the eastern limit, corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street."
The estimated location of the Saigyo-ku Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the Saikyo-ku Station on the West Japan Railway San'in Main Line (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Saikyo-ku Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line in a north-south direction.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (about 120 meters) square, by major and minor roads running east-west and north-south."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west, excluding the two rows on the north side, is called a ""条"" (jō). A group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊"" (bō)."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
"The width of the roads was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for small lanes, and over 8 zhang (about 24 meters) for main roads."
Existing roads in Kyoto are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters).
"Also, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishihorikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu established the capital at Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that this move aimed to establish a new capital for the Tenji Emperor lineage, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Tenmu Emperor lineage was concentrated."
"However, only ten years later, in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent deposition of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyo's construction."
The construction of Heian-kyō is thought to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"The right bank of Kyoto, being located in a wetland area formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), remained largely undeveloped until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely defunct, there were instances of the capital's land being left desolate and even converted into farmland, a practice strictly forbidden within the city limits."
"Aristocratic residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was located near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical text compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories, following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it records the 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the tenth year of the Jōgan era (819), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryōzen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three others died before the project was completed, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsu no, Naohiro-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minemori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, commanding Fujiwara no Tsugushi, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Shikatori to carry out the task."
"Later, after adding Furutaka-niwa and Yamada Koji, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation took 21 years, and it was Fujiwara no Otsugu alone who was involved in the project throughout, spanning the reigns of three emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" it records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the work was scattered until the early 15th century. It was rediscovered and first published by Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of Hanawa Hokiichi, who found 10 volumes in the Sanjo-nishi family. (Another theory suggests that it was discovered in a revised edition by Yanagihara Kikō.)"
"The extant volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kanmu), 14 and 17 (Heijo), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is entirely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the ""Nihonki Ryaku"" (an abridged version of the Six National Histories), to some extent, by referencing citations from it in the ""Ruijū Kokushi"" (a categorized compilation of the Six National Histories)."
"Among the collections of miscellaneous writings from various sources, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun."" Based on these, the following works are published by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
The content is said to most reflect the opinions of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of including short biographies (kōden) in death notices for emperors and court officials, following the precedent set by the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued,"" was continued in subsequent historical texts."
"However, this book's account of the Emperor's death does not simply follow the usual one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but includes many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and observations, making it an outlier in the Six National Histories for its persistent critical spirit."
"It is also known that among the Six National Histories, it contained more waka poems than preceding or succeeding historical works."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some say her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara Motosuke (908-990), a renowned poet and one of the ""Five of the Pear Jar."""
"There is an old legend that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" from the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" but this is nothing more than a nonsensical theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"Among the siblings, there are the Chief of Music Tainari, the Vice Minister of the Left Taijashomon, the priest Kaishu of the Flower Mountain Palace, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yoshinori (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name, a lady-in-waiting's title, is said to have been taken from the surname Kiyohara and the family's official position, ""Shonagon."""
"The real name is unknown, though some sources, like ""Makura no Soshi,"" suggest ""Nagiko,"" but this is not credible."
"She was counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Poems of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the version; the most widely circulated version contains 31 poems) has been passed down."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was the 12th Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe  Nagahiro."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his own mother's son."
"Although initially a Buddhist monk, he escaped from Kyoto with the aid of Mitsuhide Hosokawa and other retainers after Yoshiki was assassinated by Nagahisa Matsu."
He was then supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province to ascend to Kyoto and become the 15th Shogun.
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle him."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively marking its demise."
He later spent his remaining years with the aid of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13th, 1537 (Tenbun 6), as the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Having an older brother, Yoshiaki, who was heir apparent, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin temple of Kofukuji) as a ward of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Trio, and his younger brother, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, Ashikaga Yoshimasa, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsu permanent Hidehisa and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple (It is said that Hidehisa and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, as he was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple abbot in the future, so they confined him instead of killing him)."
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monkhood and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, such as ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and is said to have been attacked by night thieves, leading to the moniker ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jugoi no ge, and appointed to the post of Sama no kami."
"While there are doubts about the date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), Tokitsugu, who was the envoy for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's envoy came to his residence and requested mediation for his promotion to the rank of Jushi no ge. This clearly indicates that he had already been appointed before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku father and son, Yoshikata and Yoshiharu, in Omi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshitaka of Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal strife and power struggles among its senior retainers. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at his side, and he had no intention of actively going up to Kyoto with the newly secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the ascent to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there are no historical records of Yoshiaki having officially come of age at this point, making his coming of age incredibly late for the time.)"
"Later, with the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a high-ranking retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and appointed as a Sangi (Councilor) and Sa-kon'e-gon-no-chūjō (Middle General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard)."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway for almost the entire route. There is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Railway, and both connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is used."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodo River's right bank, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
It is a double-double track system with separate double tracks (outer and inner lines) throughout the entire section.
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru/ICOCA, JR East Suica, JR Central TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line features rapid express, rapid, and local trains (Kyoto-Hanshin Local Line) that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as limited express trains to Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains extend to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically, with the introduction of overnight express trains to Kyushu originating from Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express service to the San'in region, which began operating after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all extending their routes to Kyoto."
"Launched concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, the Haruka (train) began operating regularly to Kyoto within a year, creating a corridor of express trains with four departures per hour between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and others."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, with the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line after passing through the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka, enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (Platform 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the journey takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains that run on the outer tracks on the same section, and sometimes two express trains arrive at Shin-Osaka at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with the outer track capable of 130km/h operation except for a few curved sections."
"The inner track is also designed for 120 km/h, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains or special trains)."
Express trains running on this section are as follows:
"In addition, freight trains such as ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tamba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" run on this section for entering and leaving the Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot)."
"Moreover, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Hokubu Freight Line for deadheading."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds in the down direction from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is taken when departing.)"
"Therefore, when running in and out of the station, the formation is reversed."
"The New Rapid Service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, and the Sanyo Line's Amagasaki, Kamigori, and Harima-Aioi stations on the Ako Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, and Omi-Shiotsu and Tsuruga stations on the Hokuriku Line."
"From midday to night, trains run every 15 minutes, with one midday train going to the Kosei Line and the remaining three going directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains operate with JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, in 8- or 12-car formations."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a 100km long high-standard expressway (National Route 478)."
"It traverses the long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, revitalizing the region, and serving as a southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a fragile high-standard road network."
"The Kyoto Governor refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the middle section, and the ending point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, the term ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway"" often refers specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side will not end here, but will extend as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"Furthermore, the section between Kuze-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies, making the passage of small vehicles impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are unable to pass.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita-Honsen Toll Booth (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  At the same time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section, Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and a new Ayabe Ankokuji Toll Plaza will be established."
"The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. As a result, there will be no toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway."
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyoto-Tanba Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with a scheduled opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Route 9 Old Nozaki Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, while the Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT - Maizuru Ooe IC (two-lane, divided highway)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC number column indicate sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is not yet complete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the appointment number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, with the entire Mount Hiei, at an elevation of 848 meters, as its grounds."
"Though it is formally known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei is more commonly referred to as Hieizan or Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasho and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism, alongside Mount Koya's Kongobu-ji Temple."
"It embraced the teachings of Tendai, Esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land practices, making it a comprehensive university of Buddhism. During the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial family and nobility, wielding significant influence."
"In particular, esoteric rituals and prayers, especially those of the Shingon sect, gained support among the Heian aristocracy.  The esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple, associated with the Shingon sect, was known as ""To-mitsu,"" while that of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Dai-mitsu,"" and the two vied for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collection of temples and structures scattered across the eastern slopes of Mount Hiei, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and other structures across sixteen valleys."
It began in 788 when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijō Shikan-in.
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"", which took the era name of its founding, was only granted in 824 AD, fourteen years after Saicho's death."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced countless renowned monks, including Ennin and Enchin who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren the founder of Nichiren Buddhism.  Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history practiced at Mount Hiei in their youth, leading to the temple being called the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training such as ""12 years of mountain seclusion"" and ""1,000 days of mountain circumambulation"" continues to this day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, a mountain whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a site of mountain worship since ancient times. The Hie Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuo-no-obi Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (some sources say 767)."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained (became a monk) under the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 (the 4th year of the Enryaku era), he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, becoming a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, chose not to seek a secure position at a major temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, dedicating himself to rigorous training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho, considering the teachings of the Lotus Sutra the highest among all scriptures, studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""Great Concentration and Insight"") authored by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi-do, a Monju-do, and a Sutra Repository at the current site of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which takes its name from an era, was granted only after Saicho's death, in 824 AD, during the Hongan era."
"Emperor Kanmu, during his reign, became a devotee of Saicho. With the support of the Emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national guardian temple, protecting Kyoto from the ""oni-mon"" (north-east) direction."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a ""gengakusho,"" a short-term overseas student."
"In 804, he sailed to Tang Dynasty on a Japanese envoy ship."
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dosui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Giman."
"Moreover, he studied esoteric Buddhism from the Ācārya Shun'gyō at Ryūkō-ji Temple in Kōshū (Shaoxing), and Zen from the Zen master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While typically considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, there are alternative interpretations (discussed later)."
The name is also read as Tsukiyomi.
"While the Kojiki mentions the slaying of the food deity, leading to the general perception of it as a male deity, the texts do not contain any descriptions that definitively determine its gender."
"Many other cultures feature moon deities as goddesses, and even more have warlike goddesses, so the fact that the deity who killed the food goddess is male is not conclusive evidence and some scholars argue that it was a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, fleeing from the underworld, performed a ritual purification and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, forming the three deities."
"On the other hand, the *Nihon Shoki* presents a different account, stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the *Kojiki*, and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. Moreover, the extent of her dominion varies, encompassing heaven, the sea, and other areas."
"Tsukiyomi, born as a counterpart to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, has been noted in comparative mythology to have similar conceptual parallels in various other myths."
"For example, in the Chinese Pangu myth (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon after his death. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as the same deity only occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the common worldwide myth of the sun and moon being born as a pair.
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall activity is limited."
"Only briefly, in the fifth section of the eleventh book of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" is the origin of grains mentioned."
There is also a theory that this balances things out by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting characters of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can be seen in the case of Amenominakanushi, the deity associated with Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and in the case of Hosuseri, the deity associated with Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [the other deity] are the same god, as their domains and stories overlap in part."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity, born from Izanagi's right eye, is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""inform the land of food of the night,"" but there is no further record of his deeds."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The Fifth Section of the Kojiki's ""Age of the Gods"" simply states that ""the god of the moon, radiating light that shines next to the sun, was born and sent to heaven to rule alongside the sun."" However, a different account in the First Book describes Izanagi taking a white bronze mirror in his left hand to give birth to Ōhirume-no-mikoto, and a white bronze mirror in his right hand to give birth to Tsukoyomi-no-mikoto."
"While some accounts describe Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, others tell of her being commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" likely stemming from the belief that the moon controls the tides. These multiple accounts of the birth of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the fifth section, the eleventh book of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi, the food goddess, in the heavens. He descended to meet her."
"There is a myth that the food deity, in an act of hospitality, offered food from her mouth, which angered the moon god, Tsukiyomi, who killed her with his sword."
"From the corpse of the food deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji, a title for officials in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system, belonged to the Onmyōryō, a department of the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"The position of a technical officer who was assigned to perform divination and geomancy based on the principles of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, and later came to oversee all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals beyond the original legal regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sound being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, positing that all phenomena are constituted by combinations of these principles, along with closely related disciplines such as astronomy, calendar, Yi Jing, and timekeeping, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan during the Asuka period (5th to 6th centuries), no later than 512 CE (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when the Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when the Yi Jing scholar arrived."
"Although the initial impact of these disciplines on politics and culture was minimal, the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko's reign), who is considered the pioneer of Onmyōdō in Japan, marked a significant turning point. He lectured these disciplines to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shōtoku, leading to a profound influence on the nation's governance."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, began to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods. The Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility also strongly reflect the influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought."
"Thereafter, the court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the western coast of the Korean peninsula, where the ships often stopped, in order to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became crucial to ""consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, and stars, and to determine auspiciousness, misfortune, and good or bad fortune based on the principles of the five elements (yin-yang and five elements) and their mutual generation and overcoming, thereby obtaining guidance for all aspects of human affairs."" Consequently, the yin-yang and five elements philosophy was highly valued as a means to judge auspiciousness and misfortune and obtain a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination who even consulted the *shi* himself during the Jinshin War, demonstrating his deep understanding of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, established the ""Yin-Yang Office"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (Year 4 of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the increasing prevalence of Yin-Yang and Five Elements thought.  The Yōrō Code of 718 formally established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, and mandated the appointment of permanent officials, including astronomers, Yin-Yang scholars, Onmyōji, calendar experts, and clepsydra experts.  This officially recognized the role of divination, alongside the divination practices of the Shrine Department."
"Only those skilled in the arts, responsible for technologies passed down from the mainland, were appointed as doctors and onmyoji. These individuals were often immigrants proficient in various disciplines and skilled in reading classical Chinese texts. They came from various parts of the mainland, including the former Han dynasties, Sui, which later dominated the mainland, and the Korean peninsula, specifically Goguryeo and Baekje on the west coast, and occasionally Silla, which initially held power on the east coast."
"Particularly, following the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula and the Baekje dynasty fell.  In the period surrounding this event, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje came to Japan as refugees, many of whom were appointed to government positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Office's techniques were purely focused on divination, geomancy (similar to modern-day ""Feng Shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and clepsydra operation. It solely predicted the future through theoretical analysis based on the Yin Yang and Five Elements, without engaging in religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, it played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the court, determining the auspiciousness of land and directions, and influencing decisions regarding relocation of the capital."
The structure of the Onmyōryō as a Ritsuryō government institution and the duties of Onmyōji.
"The Onmyōryō has, as administrative officials, clerks..."
"The office oversees the Yin Yang Bureau, supervising all aspects of astronomy, calendar, weather, and signs. In case of anomalies, they record and seal them without leaking information to the outside, and report them secretly to the Emperor (Astronomical Secret Report). They also submit the new year's calendar created by the Calendar Doctor by November 1st every year (Imperial Calendar Report). Furthermore, they submit reports on divination and geomancy as needed."
