The Doshisha is an educational institution that includes Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College.
"Doshisha is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational institutions bearing the name ""Doshisha,"" ranging from university to kindergarten, founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, based on the Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) denomination. (As of April 2005)"
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 students were studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University is rated <AA+> by Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
&lt;AA+&gt; is the second highest of 21 ratings.
"It ranks among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Jōichi Shimoda envisioned the cultivation of individuals who could ""apply conscience to their skills"" as the purpose of his educational institution."
"It was our desire to cultivate individuals whose ""consciences are filled with goodness,"" by implementing ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel with knowledge education, to avoid undue emphasis on the latter."
"Monuments inscribed with his words, in his own handwriting, stand at Doshisha University and other schools."
"This monument of conscience bears the inscription, ""May there arise a man whose conscience fills his whole body."""
"Moreover, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" has been put forward as a concrete means of realizing this ""conscience"" education, aiming to cultivate individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation."""
It is a Christian Protestant school corporation with roots in the Congregationalist tradition.
"However, it differs in nature from so-called mission-oriented universities, and does not make Christian evangelization its primary purpose (it does not use education as a means of evangelization)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, established in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded Doshisha English School in Marutamachi, Teramachi-dori, Kyoto."
Moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa in 1876.
"Doshisha Branch School Women's Department was established in April 1877, and renamed Doshisha Girls' School in September."
"1883, Doshisha established its regulations."
The establishment of Doshisha University was announced in major newspapers and magazines across the country in 1888.
"In 1896, the ordinary school was renamed Doshisha Higher Ordinary School."
Founded Doshisha Elementary School.
"1897, M.F. Denton established the Demachi Kindergarten."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"For ""Ikkyū-san no tonchi-doro"", see the entry for ""Ikkyū-doro"" (some information is also on this page). For the television anime ""Ikkyū-san"", see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san""."
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
The secret tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu.
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"Later, he was known as Zhou Jian and took the aliases Kuang Yunzi, Xia Lu, and Meng Gui."
"The Dharma name is Soshu, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" entry for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Ankokuji temple's Image External Collection and received precepts, being named Zhou Jian."
"His poetic talent was evident from a young age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Kenō Sōi and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it can't be definitively determined if it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"In 1415, he became a disciple of the high priest, Kasou Soudon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto."
"For the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Rice,"" Ikkyu answered, ""From the world of form to the world of formlessness I return. Rest for a while. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow,"" and thus received the Dharma name Ikkyu from Hwaso."
"""Aroji"" refers to the world of delusion, while ""Muroji"" refers to the world of enlightenment."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the crow's call."
"Huasou intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verse, calligraphy and painting, and eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shokō died without male heirs, and Emperor Go-Hanazono, from the Fushimi-no-miya family, was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation played a role in the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hoshino.
"From ""The Chronological Record of Ikkyū Sōjō of Tōkai."""
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Gokasho was due to the shogunate's approval, and Ikkū's recommendation played no role."
"In the sixth year of the Bunmei era (1474), after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by the Imperial decree of Emperor Gotsu-sho. Although he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877, following the Emperor's relocation to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) due to the Meiji Restoration's move to Tokyo."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace since the Meiji era.
"The original official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, the Inner Palace, was located near the center of the city. However, due to war and other disturbances, it fell into ruin and the Imperial Court moved to the Satouchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Satō Inner Palaces, and it served as the residence of successive emperors of the Jimyōin-tō, which would later be known as the Northern Court."
"The imperial palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at Nijō Tomikoji."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace itself, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the 21st century, is classified as ""Imperial Family property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, stand Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Gosho, Kyoto Daimyo Gosho, and Sendo Gosho, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"However, unlike overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. Some believe this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity between commoners and their rulers (emperors and other members of the Imperial Family) in Eastern and Western cultures."
"For example, the fact that events like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (King) during the French Revolution, by the common people have not occurred in Japan is one of the grounds for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, called the Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six of which were due to fires), and the current building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was rebuilt in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo only a decade prior, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered its preservation and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"The main buildings include Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunego-ten, Koshun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, it was stipulated by the old Imperial Household Law enacted in 1889 that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa held their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the enthronement ceremony, such as Kyoto. For the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony for the present Emperor was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo in 1990, coinciding with his ascension to the throne in the Heisei era."
"The Takamikura, the ceremonial throne where the Emperor sits during his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the throne was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a simple wooden structure, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality for a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jo-mei Gate, you will find the Shishinden directly in front of you."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
The following focuses on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, it refers to all musical pieces performed by the Department of Music, excluding Western music."
Much of it is preserved as instrumental music in court music.
It is the oldest musical style in the world that is still performed today in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of gagaku, it had been discontinued for over a century, from the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate brought together descendants of musicians (gakka) to reorganize it. Therefore, it is questionable to what extent it retains the form of the Heian period."
"It is speculated that the singing of the hichiriki score written in katakana, with its characteristic 16th-century Japanese pronunciation, such as the “ha” sound being pronounced as “fafi-fufe-fo,” accurately reflects the original performance style."
"Many similarities exist between the notation used in *raku biwa* scores and the *pipa* scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, suggesting that both forms inherit many ancient continental styles."
"The most important historical material is the ""Taigensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shō no Gakka compiled records on Gagaku and Bugaku, centered around the shō, providing valuable documentation of ancient Gagaku."
"It originated from ceremonial music transmitted from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed for rituals."
"However, Tang music, said to have been transmitted from China, which is now performed in Japanese gagaku, is believed to be based on the music of Yanle, a form of entertainment music played at banquets during the Tang dynasty."
"The categories of music also include names of international character, such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin'yi music (Champa music), suggesting the presence of elements of ancient Japanese music predating the transmission of music from the continent."
"Before the modern period, the Tennoji Gakuso of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Taisha (Nara) were considered the three great musical centers."
"These musical institutions were later called to Tokyo in the modern era, becoming the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music clubs, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been mutually influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, developing a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, around 100 pieces of music are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
Lyrics refer to S-country style kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside of Japan (some consider this the only true definition of gagaku).
"Left-hand dance, Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Lin-yi (South Vietnam) origins."
"Right-hand dance, Koryo music... Korean, Balhae (Northeastern China) lineage."
"These include songs (Honkyoku) produced in Japan, imitating the above style."
Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono)
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, kokufu kabuki and yōmon are collectively referred to as ancient songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born in 737 AD as the first son of Prince Shirakawa (later Emperor Kōnin).
"According to the Chronicle of Japan, Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her ancestry back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu produced Ando (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while his wife, Fujiwara no Tabiko, gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinryo, was of low-born, naturalized descent from the Wazumi clan.  As a result, he was not considered a candidate for the crown prince and initially sought a career in the bureaucracy, holding positions such as Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Middle Affairs."
"However, in a political struggle that involved the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed. On January 2, 773, he was made Crown Prince."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijō-kyō, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, Heian-kyō was built in 784, but it was rebuilt again in 794."
"He then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the Sei-i Taishogun, to conquer the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship his military and construction projects imposed on the peasantry."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of culture."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, and the exile and death in 785 of Prince  Sayara, the younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince, under charges of  involvement in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane-tsugu, casting a dark shadow over the beginning of the reign."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was retroactively designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the position of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too involved in politics and held too much power, by confiscating their estates and other measures."
"It is also said that the disorder within the imperial palace was rampant, laying the groundwork for the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17, 806."
"He was given the posthumous title Yamato-neko Amatsuhitsugi-iyade-no-Mikoto, a Japanese-style title."
He was posthumously given the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
"He was also called Emperor Kashiwabara, and Emperor Kashiwabara of the Heavenly Realm."
"The mausoleum is said to be located at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first Emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All Emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his annual press conference held before his birthday, Emperor Akihito mentioned in his comments about the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year: ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the Chronicles of Japan records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Muyeong of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and discussed by the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory."""
"The Otani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakkei, son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hino was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, and inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of Honganji, the largest branch of the sect."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split from the former in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The surname Otani originated from the location of the mausoleum of Shinran, which was established in the Ootani area, north of the main gate of Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Honnō-ji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), held a power comparable to that of warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement. Therefore, it is often counted among the warlords. Also, the temple head's posthumous Buddhist name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honnō-ji"", as in ""Honnō-ji Kannon"" or ""Honnō-ji Kosuke"". However, this is merely a matter of convenience in naming. The family line of the Honnō-ji Temple head never used ""Honnō-ji"" as a family name or surname, and there was no such family as the ""Honnō-ji clan""."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ohtani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern mountains, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became the Ootani Temple, revered by the followers of Jodo Shinshu, and Kakukei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, became the caretaker."
"However, the Ohtani Temple, due to the pilgrimages and donations from followers across the land, later became embroiled in a dispute over the absentee position between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and his half-brother Yuisen. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee position by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Honganji."
"Since then, the Hongwanji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, has been developing its religious organization. During the Muromachi period, under the fifth generation, Shakujo, it expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh generation, Jonyo, the Hongwanji Temple had established its religious organization in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working towards establishing a religious institution since Shinran's death, the formation of the Honganji temple was significantly delayed. During the early Muromachi period, the Honganji temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in temple. The Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), are said to have served as stewards to the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of the 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Ootani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and then to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki erupted in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Kaga Honganji sect governed, leading to the province being known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was virtually ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, wielding its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, expanded its activities throughout Japan. However, the Yamaoka Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon-Hokke Rebellion. The 10th abbot, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, established by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka), and renamed it Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located at the summit of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic point for river transportation at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"With Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his base, Shōnyo forged close ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court, solidifying the Hongan-ji's power base."
"On the other hand, towards the end of Shonyo's era, some within the Honganji Buddhist sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, were beginning to deviate from the central authority of Honganji and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Honganji Temple, which had become a de facto independent daimyo power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region, aiming to seize territorial power from religious forces and establish unified rule."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple, led by Kannon, entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, gaining the upper hand through a collaboration with their followers who resisted the Oda clan across the land. This put significant pressure on Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed. These events, along with other local resistances being suppressed, led to a string of defeats for the Honganji outside its own domain. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji, suffered a naval defeat at the Battle of Kizugawa against the Oda navy."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple maintained its strength by continuing to gather support from groups like the Saika, it gradually became isolated amongst its enemies. In 1580, it finally surrendered to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to leave Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple. This marked the end of Hongan-ji Temple as a territorial power."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, advocated for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was chosen as his successor."
"From this point, the Honganji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of the chief priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the Eastern Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyonyo."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in the division of the Honganji temple into east and west."
"Originally the descendants of Shinran, a son of the noble Hino Arimitsu, and the heads of the Eastern and Western Otani families, who traced their lineage back to Hino Hirotsuna (the father of Kakunyo), had a tradition of being adopted by powerful noble families.  Moreover, they continuously intermarried with nobles, leading to a gradual increase in their own nobility through their maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, at the center of the triangular area of the three prefectures."
"It is bounded by the Kizu River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, with the West Japan Railway Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line passing through its center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are largely characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status established, formerly Tsuzuki District, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuchiya District, Kyoto Prefecture, which was originally ""Tanabe Town, Kyoto Prefecture,"" was designated as ""Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" in a municipal incorporation ordinance.  On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" to ""Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture."""
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
It's known for its thriving tea (Uji tea) cultivation and boasts Gyokuro as a specialty product.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City.
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"The bus depot will relocate on May 10, 2008."
Companies with offices in the city.
"Yamajiro-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (adjacent Itecho, Tsuzuki District is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannonji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to a national treasure, the Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Ikkyū Zenji and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe city, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run through to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and was renamed to match the city's name at about the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While there is a ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii,"" the former province of Wakayama, in the station name located within Tanabe City appears to be intended to avoid duplication with other station names within the jurisdiction of West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot located within the city)"
Musashi Province was one of the provinces of Japan under the Ritsuryo system.
"This corresponds to the area that includes present-day Saitama Prefecture, the area east of the Sumida River in Tokyo excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, provincial governor ranking, distant provinces."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyo, built on land spanning across both Katsura and Atago counties in Yamashiro Province, corresponding to the present-day central area of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a rectangular city with dimensions of 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"They established the Imperial Palace at the north end center of the capital, and from there, they extended the Suzaku Avenue to the center of the city, with the left capital (Sakyo) and right capital (Ukyo) on either side (east being Sakyo and west being Ukyo)."
"The plan is essentially based on Heijo-kyo, following the model of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this site was based on the concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony"" from Chinese Feng Shui."
The extent of Heian-kyō was smaller than present-day Kyoto City.
"The northernmost street, Ichijō-ōji, is Ichijō-dōri, located between the present-day Imadegawa-dōri and Marutamachi-dōri."
The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is currently the Kujō-dori street just south of JR Kyoto Station.
The Eastern Limit of Tokyo's Grand Avenue corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the westernmost Nishikyogoku-Oji is a line connecting the JR Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station in a north-south direction.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running east-west and north-south."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west, excluding the two rows on the northern edge, is called a ""条"" (jo). A group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊"" (bo)."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each assigned a number.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
"The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for a small lane, and over 8 zhang (about 24 meters) for a major road."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
It reached a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters) at Zhuque Avenue.
"Also, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishihorikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishihorikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyō in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been intended to establish a new capital for the Tenji Emperor lineage, breaking away from Yamato Province, which was the stronghold of the aristocracy and temples that supported the Tenmu Emperor lineage."
"However, only ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing the Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent deposition of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyō."
The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded with the construction of the city (urban area).
"The right bank of Kyoto, being a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), remained undeveloped even in the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely obsolete, the capital city fell into disrepair, and there were even instances of land within its boundaries, which was originally forbidden for agriculture, being converted to farmland."
"Noble residences were established in the Sakyo district, except for the northern part of the Ukyo district, which was located near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical text compiled in early Heian period, commissioned by the imperial court. It is the third of the six national histories, following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD) in Japan, it records 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the year 819, Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"Three people, excluding Otsugu, died while the work remained unfinished, so later Emperor Junwa issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Nao-yo Wang, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mine-mori, Sakanoe Ima-tsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, a further edict was issued, entrusting the task to Fujiwara Tsugushi, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jōwa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation, spanning 21 years and three reigns, was a project solely undertaken by Fujiwara no Otsugu."
"Following the *Nihon Shoki*, it records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting midway through the reign of Emperor Kanmu."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the work was scattered until the early 15th century. It was rediscovered by Inayama Gyokyo, a student of Handa Koreyoshi, in the Sanjo-nishi family, where he found ten volumes (alternatively, it is said that Yanagihara Kiko's annotated edition was discovered). This discovery led to the first publication of the work."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes.  The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"The ""Nihon Kiryaku"", an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories"", and the ""Ruijuu Kokushi"", a categorized index of the ""Six National Histories"", can be used to reconstruct the original text to a certain degree."
"There are ""Nihon Ichi Shi"" and ""Nihon Goki Itbun"", which are collections of anecdotes from various sources. Based on these, the following publications are available: Shueisha's Annotated Japanese Historical Materials and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
The content is said to most reflect Fujiwara Otsugu's opinions.
"The practice of adding brief biographies (kōden) to the death notices of emperors and court officials followed the precedent of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" and was consistent with subsequent historical texts."
"However, the book's account of the emperor's death avoids one-sided, official praise or condemnation, instead offering numerous intriguing descriptions laced with unique criticism and commentary, making it an anomaly among the six national histories for its unwavering critical spirit."
It is also known that the Rikkokushi included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical works.
Sei Shōnagon (c. 966 – c. 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some say her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" circle."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother of [name] as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosenshu Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (or perhaps my grandfather) was Ki no Fukayabu, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are siblings, including the head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Jishin, the priest of the Imperial Palace, Kaishu of the Hanazono lineage, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (the brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name is a court lady's title, ""Sei"" being derived from the surname Kiyohara, and ""Shonagon"" from a relative's official position."
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, such as the ""Makura no Sōshi Chō,"" claim it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is unreliable."
"He was counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and his small collection of 42 poems, *Sei Shonagon's Collection* (the number of poems varies depending on the edition, 31 in the most common one), survives."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū"" (The Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry), there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, the daughter of Konoe Nobumichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his full brother."
"He was initially a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"And, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, he ascended to Kyoto and became the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, and in alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura, forge a network to encircle him."
"Although they once cornered Nobunaga, they were eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending the Muromachi shogunate."
He later spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13th, 1537 (Tenbun 6), as the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his older brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijouin Temple of Kofukuji) as a ward of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfukuji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Trio, while his younger brother, the Abbot of Rokuon-in, Ashikaga Yoshitaka, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofuku-ji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofuku-ji Temple an enemy by killing Gakkan, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of abbot of Kofuku-ji Temple in the future, and so they confined him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monkhood and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that chronicle Yoshiaki's life mention that he was also known as ""Buke Gosho""."
"When he was driven from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and is said to have been called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jushi no Ge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Sama no Kami (Head of the Left Horse Division)."
"While there are doubts about the exact date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu-kyoki,"" during the ceremony in February 1568, when Yoshiaki's rival, Ashikaga Yoshiie, was appointed Shogun, Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the ceremony, was approached by Yoshiaki's envoy who requested his mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi-no-ge. This confused Tokitsugu, and it is clear that Yoshiaki had been appointed prior to this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Ōmi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son, Takeda Yoshitaka in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among their senior retainers. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage, already holding Ashikaga Tsugutom, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate, in his ""Kuradani Gosho"" residence, was not willing to actively go up to Kyoto with the newly-laicized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, and so the ascent to Kyoto never happened."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (Moreover, there is no historical record of Yoshiaki having officially come of age at this point, which makes his coming of age, at that time, incredibly late.)"
"He later moved to Mino Province, seeking the patronage of Oda Nobunaga through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a high-ranking retainer of the Asakura clan."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been supported by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Councillor and Lieutenant General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 kilometers along the right bank of the Yodo River, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
"It is a quad-track line with four tracks in each direction, with an outer and inner track."
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru/ICOCA, as well as JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line features rapid, semi-rapid, and local trains that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as limited express trains to destinations such as the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"Following the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically as overnight trains to Kyushu that had originated in Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula that had started in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" service to the San-in region that began with the opening of the Chizu Express line, all began running through to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later. The New Osaka - Kyoto line became a ""rapid expressway"" with about four express trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird."""
"However, all sleeper express trains running between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued with the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" entering the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka Station enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (Platform 3), pass through Suita Signal Box and then arrive at Shin-Osaka."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than limited express or rapid trains that run on the outer lines of the same section, and sometimes two limited express trains arrive at Shin-Osaka at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with the outer tracks capable of 130 km/h operation except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also designed for 120 km/h, but express trains never use it (though some freight or special trains may)."
The following express trains operate on this line.
"In addition, there are also transfer trains such as the ""Hamakaze"", ""Tanba"", and ""Hokkin-ki"" that run through this section for entry and departure from Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains between Mukomachi and Osaka will use the Hokubu Freight Line for deadheading."
"When a train terminating at Osaka is brought into Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds southbound from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges with the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used when the train departs.)"
"Therefore, the front and back of the train formation are reversed when it is running in and out of the station."
"The New Rapid service operates directly from the JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Main Line Amagasaki, Joge, Ako Line Banshu-Ako area, through the JR Kyoto Line, to the Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to night, trains operate every 15 minutes.  During the day, one train is routed to the Kosei Line, while the remaining three run directly to the Biwako Line."
All four trains run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains are operated using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, with either 8 or 12 carriages."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100km, is a high-standard expressway (National Route 478) starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It traverses the long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, revitalizing the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, where the high-grade road network is weak."
"The Kyoto Governor refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the middle, and the ending point. The starting point opened as the Keiz Bypass, not the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers only to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line portion of the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the Sanin Expressway."
"Furthermore, the section from Kumiyama Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so a minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc., is prohibited."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are unable to pass.
"Toll Road Sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road: Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others: West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between Ayabe Kita-Honsen Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Angokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. As a result, the currently free section from Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT will be subject to tolls."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be established."
"The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth, eliminating all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway."
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) is currently constructed like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyoto-Tanba Wachi IC project is currently underway by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. The management structure after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: General National Route 9 Oinozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Kutsugaki IC to Chiyogawa IC was changed from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Oe IC (temporary 2-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations involved in road infrastructure were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections that are in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate facilities that are not in use or are not yet completed."
The name of the unopened section is tentative.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompassing the entire Mount Hiei, which stands at an elevation of 848 meters."
"More often than by its formal name, Enryakuji Temple, it is called Hiei-zan, or more commonly, Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The head priest (chief abbot) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobu-ji Temple."
"Besides the teachings of the Tendai sect, it also practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (shikan), and Nembutsu, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university.  During the Heian period, it gained the respect of the Imperial Family and nobility, wielding significant influence."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist practices and prayers gained the support of the Heian aristocracy, with the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple (Shingon sect) known as ""To-mitsu"" and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple as ""Dai-mitsu,"" the two vying for supremacy."
"Enryakuji is a collective term for the various halls and pagodas scattered across the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokawa."
"It began in 788, when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in."
"It was only in 824, the fourteenth year of the Kōnin era, after Saichō's death, that the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was granted, taking the year of its founding."
"Enryaku-ji Temple, having produced numerous renowned monks, is known as the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism"" because many founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history, such as Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, practiced on Mount Hiei in their youth."
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training practices such as the ""12-year hermitage"" and the ""Thousand-day pilgrimage"" continue to this day, making it a prominent sacred site in Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the Kojiki, is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hie Shrine in Sakamoto on the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity of the mountain, Ōyamagui, is enshrined."
"Saicho, also known as Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he received the tonsure (became a monk) under the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts (formal ordination as a monk) at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, becoming a fully ordained monk."
"Driven by his own convictions, young Saicho, instead of seeking a secure position in the great temples of Nara, chose to retreat to Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, and devote himself to solitary practice and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures, and he studied the ""Three Major Works on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", ""The Words of the Lotus Sutra"", and ""The Great Concentration and Insight""), written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple, consisting of a Yakushi-do, a Monju-do, and a Sutra repository, at the current site of the Main Hall, naming it Ichijo Jikan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"", which takes its name from an era, was only granted after Saicho's death, in 824, the fourteenth year of the Kōnin era."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a follower of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national center for protecting the country, guarding the north-east, Kyoto's ""oni-mon."""
"In 802 AD, Saichō was granted permission to travel to Tang as a ""Gengakushō,"" a short-term overseas student."
"In 804, he sailed to Tang on a Japanese diplomatic mission ship."
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, the sacred site of Tendai Buddhism, where he studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and also studied Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Moreover, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), he studied Esoteric Buddhism from Master Shunxiao and Zen from Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, there are alternative theories (discussed later)."
The name is also read as Tsukiyomi.
"Although the Kojiki contains a story about the slaying of Uke Mochi no Kami, generally considered a male deity, there is no explicit description in the chronicles that determines the deity's gender."
"In many other cultures, the moon god is often a goddess, and there are also many goddesses who are warlike in nature. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god and thus support the theory of a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi, while considered a moon god, has various interpretations of his divinity depending on the source material."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, having fled from the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye, Tsukiyomi, and from his nose, Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the *Nihon Shoki* presents conflicting accounts compared to the *Kojiki*, stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. Its domain of control also varies, ranging from heaven to the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, the sun goddess, mirrors a common theme in comparative mythology, where similar ideas are found across various cultures."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is an origin myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon after his death. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"Apollo, however, was originally a god distinct from Helios, the sun god, and their identification occurred later."
"Moreover, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is recounted on the fourth day, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can also be considered to follow the pattern of the worldwide myth of the sun and moon being born as a pair, a common motif in creation myths."
"Despite being considered a significant deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi has a limited presence in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, with relatively few notable feats."
"It is only slightly mentioned in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" where the origin of grains is discussed."
"There is also a theory that this is balanced by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, two deities with contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in the case of Amenominakanushi no kami for Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri for Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [the other deity] are the same god, as their domains and some of their stories overlap."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and is referred to as one of the ""Three Noble Children"" alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""inform the land of night's food,"" but he has no further exploits after that."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The Fifth Section of the Kojiki's ""Age of the Gods"" simply states that Izanagi produced a moon god who shone with a brilliance second only to the sun, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding another white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While some stories tell of Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside a counterpart, others describe her being tasked with ruling the ""eight hundred layers of the ocean's tide,"" a mandate seemingly derived from the idea of the moon controlling tides. This multiplicity of narratives surrounding the birth of the three deities exists in parallel."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth scroll, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule heaven. Later, Tsukiyomi was ordered by Amaterasu to descend from heaven and meet Ukemochi no Kami, the food goddess, on earth."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as a gesture of hospitality, offered food from her mouth, which angered Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto, who then killed her with a sword, deeming it ""unclean."""
"From the body of the Grain God, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to grains."
Onmyoji is a government position that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Ministry of Central Affairs under the ancient Japanese Ritsuryo system.
"The position of a technician (gikan) who, based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, performed divination and geomancy using Yin-Yang practices, and later came to oversee divination, sorcery, and all rituals, exceeding the original regulations of the Ritsuryo code."
"After the Middle Ages, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'yōji"" without the vowel sound being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, positing that all phenomena are formed by the combination of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, along with closely related fields like astronomy, calendar systems, Yi Jing, and timekeeping, were introduced to Japan from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) by the 5th or 6th centuries, at the latest by 512 CE (Emperor Keitai's 7th year) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (Emperor Kinmei's 15th year) when Yi Jing scholars arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little influence on politics and culture, in 602, Kanroku, who is considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, which significantly impacted the country's administration."
"The first official adoption of a calendar (Genka calendar) in Japan occurred, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), envoys were sent to Sui, a leading civilization, to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendar practices. The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought was also strongly evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (and later Tang) China, and also invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the western coast of the Korean peninsula where the envoys made port calls, in an effort to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to ""consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, and stars, interpret auspicious and inauspicious events based on the principles of the Five Elements (yin-yang, wu xing) and their interactions, and thus predict the future and obtain guidance for all aspects of human affairs."" As a result, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory came to be highly valued as a means to determine good fortune and misfortune, and to obtain a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination and deeply versed in Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, established the Yin-Yang Bureau and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign). He was so skilled that he even used divination by shi (choku) during the Jinshin War."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 AD (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), and Yin-Yang Five Elements thought became even more prevalent. In 718 AD, the Yōrō Code formally established the Onmyōryō as a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, stipulating that the positions of Astronomer, Onmyōji Doctor, Onmyōji, Calendar Doctor, and Water Clock Doctor be permanently filled. This made divination, alongside the divination by the Shrine Ministry, an official function of the state."
"Only those skilled in the techniques introduced from the mainland were appointed as doctors and Onmyoji. These individuals were often immigrants proficient in various academic disciplines and skilled in reading classical Chinese, hailing from the former and later Han dynasties of mainland China, the Sui dynasty that replaced them as the dominant power, Goguryeo and Baekje, which held sway over the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally, scholars who returned from Silla, the initial power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly, following the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent an expeditionary force to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed.  During this period, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees, many of whom were subsequently appointed to government positions."
"In its initial stages, the Yin-Yang Office's technical expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the operation of water clocks. It primarily engaged in astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting auspicious and inauspicious events through theoretical analysis based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements theory. Unlike the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks, it did not engage in any religious rituals or magic. However, it played a crucial role in the court, particularly in selecting auspicious days for construction projects, and in determining the auspiciousness of land and directions, making it essential during periods of relocation, such as the capital city's move."
The Organization of the Onmyōryō as a Ritsuryō System and the Duties of Onmyōji.
"The Onmyōryō has, as administrative officers,"
"The role of overseeing the Yin Yang Liao, supervising all matters of astronomy, calendar, weather, and signs, recording and sealing any anomalies without divulging them to the outside, and reporting them secretly to the emperor (astronomical secret report).  Submitting the new year's calendar created by the calendar doctor by November 1st each year (Imperial Calendar Report), and also reporting the results of divination and geomancy as needed."

"As a skilled technician, ..."
"An instructor who observes celestial phenomena, seals any anomalies to prevent them from leaking outside, and guides 10 astronomy students in training."
"Because astronomy was considered the most difficult of the yin-yang doctrines among the seven ranks, it was given a higher position than the other scholars."
An instructor who guides 10 Yin Yang students.
"He is ranked seventh in the Imperial Court, a position equivalent to the highest rank held by an astronomical scholar."
