The Doshisha Corporation (English: The Doshisha) is the educational corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha was founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima as a Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) school based on Christian principles, and is a comprehensive educational institution with nine schools from university to kindergarten bearing the name ""Doshisha"" (as of April 2005)."

<AA+> is ranked second out of 21 levels of ratings.
"Alongside Waseda University and Keio University, it is the top school corporation."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Shinshichi Tokashiki aimed to cultivate individuals who ""put conscience into action"" as the purpose of education."
"We wanted to produce individuals who are ""filled with conscience"" by promoting ""character education"" based on Christianity in parallel with knowledge education, so as not to be biased towards knowledge education."
"Monuments engraved with his handwriting, embodying his thoughts, can be found in various schools such as Doshisha University."
"The words ""May the spirit of righteousness pervade the whole body and bring forth a sturdy rising"" are engraved on this monument of conscience."
"Furthermore, in order to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, educational principles of ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
It is a Protestant Christian school corporation that follows the Congregationalist tradition (Union Church).
"However, it is different from so-called mission-based universities, as it does not have the main purpose of Christian evangelism (and does not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."

"Born in Kyoto, he was said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara Nagachika, ""Tohbojo Nagachika Ki,"" on the first day of August in the third year of Meio (1494), it is written: ""It is said in secret that the monk Ikkyu was a prince born of the Empress Dowager of Gosho."""
"""There is no one in the world who knows it."""
The childhood name is said to be Senkiku Maru according to later historical records.
"He was called by the name Zhou Jian, and was also known as Kuang Yunzi, Xa Lu, and Mu Kei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shushun, also written as Shojun."
Ikyu is a road sign.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist name"" section for information on posthumous Buddhist names and temple names."
"At the age of 6, he entered the Image Outside Collection of AnkokujI Temple in Kyoto, took the vows, and was given the name Shukei."
"He showed great talent in poetry from an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Chomon Harugusa,"" written at the age of 13, and ""Shunshi Sukka,"" written at the age of 15, were highly praised and acclaimed in the capital city of Kyoto."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Sui and changed his name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's behavior is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Ōei (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a high priest of Daikakuji in Kyoto."
"He received the title ""Ikkyu"" from the master Hotsu for his response to the koan ""The Stick of Dongshan."" His response was: ""Going from nothing to nothing, taking a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Having a path"" refers to the world of delusion (defilements), while ""Not having a path"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddhahood)."
"One night in the 27th year of Oei (1420), I suddenly realized upon hearing the cawing of crows."
"The old man tried to give a written permission, but Ikkyu declined."
It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"After that, I lived a life of poetry, kyoka, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Shōkō passed away without leaving a male heir, and was succeeded by Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in Tokai"""
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio states that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono Emperor was supported by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the sixth year of the Bunmei era following the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and although he did not reside in the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho) is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo visit of the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and it was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it was also known as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but due to wars and other reasons, it was moved to Rikyu Palace."
"The Togu Palace of the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in was one of the palaces in this village, where the imperial family of the Jomyo-in line, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which is known as the Southern Court, was located in the Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in, but rather an expansion based on the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is also open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Imperial Court moved to Tokyo in the second year of the Meiji era (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north on Imadegawa Street are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both campuses are located on Imadegawa Street)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Sento Palace, and the Senkyo Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Imperial Garden, which is a national park surrounding them."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace as ""Gosho,"" which also includes the Kyoto Imperial Garden."
"However, unlike castles overseas, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. There is a theory that this difference in the sense of closeness between the common people and rulers (emperors and imperial family members, for example) in the East and West is reflected in this."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). Such incidents have not occurred in Japan, which is one of the reasons for this consideration."
"Originally, the Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a position northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the JR Nijo Station in Kyoto."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the retired Emperor, called the Tsuchimikado Higashitoin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of Genko (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was located here has been rebuilt 8 times only in the Edo period (6 of which were rebuilt due to fire damage), and the existing building was rebuilt in the late Edo period in the 2nd year of Ansei (1855) following the Heian style, and is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of the Meiji era (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"Main buildings include Shishinden, Seiryo-den, Kogosho, O-gakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the former Imperial Household Law established in Meiji 22 (1889), the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai were to be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also conducted their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"In addition, there are no specific provisions in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II regarding the location where the ceremonies should be held, and for the enthronement of the current Emperor in 1990, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time in history at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"When the Emperor ascends to the throne, he sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing his reign, which is located in the Shishin-den of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokuirei Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishin-den no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
"Sugi, kirizuma-zukuri, hiwada-buki, hashira-ai ikken no shikyakumon de aru."
"The gate is only opened for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, VIPs, or public opening."
"The left and right walls of the Tsuijibei have five horizontal lines, indicating the highest level of prestige as a wall."
"Upon passing through this gate and under the vermilion-lacquered tiled gate called the Shoumeimon, one will arrive at the front of the Shikyuden."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following describes Japanese gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency Music Department (Important Intangible Cultural Asset).
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, it refers to the music played by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, excluding Western music."
Many are inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the world's oldest style of traditional music that is still performed in large ensemble form even today.
"However, as a form of traditional court music ensemble, it had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of court musicians (gakka) and reorganized it, so it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been inherited."
"It is speculated that when singing the musical score written in katakana for the hichiriki, the pronunciation of the Ha column is pronounced as fa, fi, fu, fe, fo, reflecting the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century. Overall, it is believed that the pronunciation is faithfully reproduced."
"Things written in kanji, like the music score of the biwa called ""raku biwa,"" share many similarities with the biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China. Furthermore, many stylistic elements passed down from an even older continent are also preserved."
"One of the most important historical sources is ""Taigen-sho"" written by Toyohara Tsuneaki (1450-1512) out of concern for the dispersal of records of Gagaku and other arts during the Ōnin War."
"""Tsutomu Aki, a member of the Rakka family, compiled records about gagaku and bugaku centered around the sho, making it a valuable record of ancient gagaku."""
"The music for ritual ceremonies originated from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, it is said that Tang music, which originated from music played at banquets called Yan music in the Tang Dynasty in China, has been transmitted."
"As a category of music, there are various colorful names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linyi music (music of Champa) that have been passed down, including elements of ancient Japanese music from before the introduction of continental music."
"Before modern times, the Sanpo Gakusho, which were considered the three main music halls that preserved the oldest styles, were the Tennoji Gakusho at Shitenno-ji Temple in Osaka, the Dainai Gakusho at the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, and the Nanto Gakusho at Kasuga Taisha Shrine in Nara."
"These places of music were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each place of music continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, there are influences between folk songs and statements, and a unique Japanese style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 pieces have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of the S-style song and dance.
Things that have been transmitted from outside of Japan (some consider only these as Gagaku).
"Left dance and Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) origins"
"Right-hand dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin."
These also include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned style (Japanese music).
Songs created during the Heian period (Utaimono)
The lyrics refer to the song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances and recitations are collectively referred to as ancient songs.
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shin-no-Kasa, the mother, is said to be a descendant of the Baekje royal family with King Munheung as an ancestor."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro bore Prince Yasuakira (later Emperor Heijou), Princess Minono (later Empress Saga), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko bore Prince Ootomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Hakuheki, ascended to the throne, it was not desired for him to become crown prince as his mother, Takano Shingasa, came from a lower-class immigrant clan, the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the center."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly removed from their positions and the Prince was proclaimed Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"They were disgusted by the growing influence of Nara Buddhism temples in Heijokyo, so they moved the capital to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built again."
"Once again, a military force led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro was sent to invade the Tohoku region and bring the Ezo people under control."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Shigetsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing hardship to the peasants with such military activities and constructions."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new developments to Japanese Buddhism under the rule of Emperor Kammu.
"Princess Inoue and Prince Hatano's unnatural deaths, at the beginning of his reign, also had a dark side of imprisoning and causing the death of Prince Hayara, who was made crown prince and was the brother of Emperor Kammu, on charges of assassinating Fujiwara no Shigetsugu in 785."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19th in the 19th year of Enryaku (800), Sōdō Tennō was posthumously named for Prince Sawara, and the tomb of Princess Inoue was also designated as a mausoleum. Additionally, the position of Empress was restored."
"Known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, while existing Buddhism has become too involved in politics and holds too much power, they have put pressure on various sects known as the ""Six Schools of Nanto"" by confiscating their land and imposing restrictions."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem contributed to the later incident known as the ""Yakko Incident."""
"He passed away on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Emperor Jimmu, the first Emperor of Japan, was posthumously given the name Yamato Takeru Ama no Hohiiru no Mikoto."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously named in the Chinese style."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tenkoku Ohatsu no Mikoto Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is considered to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum (Kashiwabara no Misasagi) in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he insisted on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashihara Mausoleum."
"With the advent of the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Palace's one of the three Imperial Mausoleums, the Ko-reiden."
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, which has become a tradition, Akihito made a statement during a press conference regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was heavily reported in the South Korean media and became a hot topic."
"Some media outlets have made significant leaps in logic by reporting that ""the Imperial Family is descended from the Korean people"" and promoting theories such as the ""Imperial Family's Baekje origins."""
"The Otani family (Otanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hino Hirosada was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest (hōshu) of the Jodo Shinshu sect's main temple, Hongan-ji."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo) which split in 1602 both took their positions as their surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum at the Otani location of the Kitano-in North Gate of Chion-in in Higashiyama, Kyoto, as mentioned later."
"Hongan-ji was counted as one of the Sengoku daimyo due to its power to rival the Sengoku daimyo under the spread of the Ikko Ikki during the Sengoku period in Japan. It is often called ""Hongan-ji Kenyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosaku"" by adding Hongan-ji to the posthumous name (Jodo Shinshu) or given name of the abbot, but this is purely for convenience of address. It does not mean that the family lineage of the Hongan-ji abbot made Hongan-ji their family name or surname, nor that there was a family called Hongan-ji."
"Kakushin-ni, when Shinran passed away in 1262, attended to his deathbed, and in 1272, she built a hall in Otani near his home in Higashiyama, Kyoto, to enshrine his remains."
"Daishoin Hall became the Daishoin Mausoleum, gathering the reverence of the followers of Jodo Shinshu as a mausoleum of Shinran, and Shinran's eldest son Kakuei was appointed to manage it as the acting head priest."
"However, the Otani Mausoleum later became the subject of a dispute between the sons of Kakuei, Kakunyo and his half-brother Yoshizen, as they competed for control over the temple's management and the donations from followers across the country. Kakunyo eventually emerged victorious and established the hereditary succession of the management of the temple within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving rise to the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited Hongan-ji, advancing the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation Shitsunyo in the Muromachi period, they expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation Sonjo, the Hongan-ji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming the denomination since the death of Shinran, the formation of the denomination in the early Muromachi period was significantly delayed. Honkokuji, in the early Muromachi period, was considered a branch temple of Seiren-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's original family), also acted as stewards for the Kujō family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed, and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yama-no-ashidistrict on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"Against the background of the expansion of the teachings during the reign of Rennyo in Kaga, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, and the Honganji sect in Kaga drove out the guardian Tomogashi family, leading to the emergence of a situation known as the ""country governed by peasants."""
"For approximately a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from small farmers, expanded its organizational power to the samurai class such as local samurai and landowners, and intensified its activities throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532 and was damaged by war. The 10th head, Shonyo, moved to the Ishiyama Gobo opened by Rennyo in Nishinaru-gun, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and renamed it Ishiyama Honganji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river traffic at the mouth of the Yodogawa River controlled Osaka.
"Shonin established Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his base and worked to strengthen ties with various daimyos, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Jodo Shinshu era, in regions such as Hokuriku, some members of the local Honganji sects were starting to deviate from the control of Honganji and pursue their own paths."
"During the time of the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji sect, which had become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by usurping feudal power from religious authorities."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple, fortified in Ishiyama, collaborating with its followers across various regions to resist the Oda clan. This alliance allowed the Honganji Temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's naval forces, allied with Honganji Temple, were defeated by the Oda naval forces in the Battle of Kizu River, furthering the string of defeats outside of Honganji Temple."
"Despite continuing to gather support from the Iga clan and others, Ishiyama Honganji maintained its strength. However, it gradually became isolated among enemies, and in 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained a decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and withdrew from Ishiyama Honganji. The power of Ishiyama Honganji as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, the eldest son Noriyuki, who advocated continuing to resist against the intentions of Kenjo, had a falling out with Kenjo. When Kenjo passed away in 1593, his third son Junjo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, the Honganji Temple began to walk the path of division over the position of the head priest, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu gave Kyonyo a separate temple site from Koken to establish the East Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers from the Jodo Shinshu sect led by Junyo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, moved to the guidance of Kyonyo, the head of Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into two factions."
"Shinran, originally the son of the nobleman Hino Arinori, and the heads of the Eastern and Western Ootani families, who are descendants of Hino Hirotsun (father of Kakunyo), have a custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful noble families, and have continued to marry into noble families for generations, leading to a further increase in nobility through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotanabe City is located in the central part of the tri-prefectural triangle area, adjacent to Yawata City, Joyo City, Ibaraki Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sōraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows north-south along the eastern side of the city of Kyoto Prefecture, and is sandwiched between the western Ikoma mountain range, with the central area being crossed by the West Japan Railway Company's Kitamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kinki Nippon Railway."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe Town in Teshiki District became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was established as the 12th city in Japan after a gap of 20 years, and the 669th city nationwide."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was given the prefix ""Kyoto"" and became ""Kyotanabe City."" On the same day, the town of Tanabe in Kyoto Prefecture was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"In addition, the new city name was selected through a general public offering."

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintoku Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsui Yamate Station."
"Kintetsu Shindenobu Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the centers of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, the Keihan Nakanoshima Station is served by regular subway trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Nishikyogoku Station and Higashimuko Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line), but the use of the old province name of Wakayama, ""Kii,"" in the name of the station in Tanabe City is believed to be to avoid duplication of station names within the same area of West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyoto Tanabe Sales Office is located in the city)"

"Musashi Province was once one of the Ritsuryo provinces, which were regional administrative divisions in Japan."
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is provincial governor, provincial class division, distant province."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in the area spanning Katsuno District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the present-day central part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture. It was a capital city that was divided into a rectangular shape measuring 4.5 km east to west and 5.2 km north to south."
"Establishing the Imperial Palace at the northern center of the capital, and from there, placing the Suzaku Avenue in the center of the city to create the districts of Rakuchu (Left Capital) and Ukyo (Right Capital) on either side (with the east being Rakuchu and the west being Ukyo)."
The layout plan basically follows Heijokyo (the ancient capital of Nara) and imitates the design of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties.
"However, there were no walls."
There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to the Feng Shui transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost main street is Ichijo-dori, located between Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The southern boundary of the ninth avenue is the current JR Kyoto Station, slightly south of Kujō Street."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's largest road corresponds to the present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Saigen on Nishikyogoku Oji Avenue is a line that connects JR West's San'in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station in a north-south direction.
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 jo (about 120 meters) on each side, running east, west, south, and north."
"A group of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called ""Jo"", and a group of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called ""Bo""."
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district had a number assigned to it.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
"The width of the road was 4 jo (approximately 12m) even in small roads, and 8 jo (approximately 24m) or more in main roads."
The existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places than this.
"At Suzaku Dori, the width was 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, the Horikawa-kouji and Nishi-Horikawa-kouji streets had rivers (Horikawa River, Nishi-Horikawa River) flowing parallel to them."
Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built the city of Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that had supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu's lineage in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi's lineage."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital once again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events that led from the assassination of Fujiwara Taneie in Nagaoka-kyo to the demotion of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo."
"It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo began with the building of the palace (dai-nairi), followed by the development of the city (shigai)."
"However, due to the fact that the area of Ukyo is a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), urbanization did not progress even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had mostly become obsolete, there were cases where land fell into disrepair and was even converted to agricultural use, which was originally prohibited within the capital."
"The residential area for the nobles was established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital near the Imperial Palace."
"Nihon Koki is a chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the Rikkokushi following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of the Jōwa era (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tenchō era (833)."
The editors are Fujiwara no Tsugutsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Kōnin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Osatsumi, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine no Yasuie to compile this document."
"Due to the deaths of the three people excluding Prince Michi, Emperor Junna later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Prince Naoyuki, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minomori, Sakagami Imotsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further decrees were issued, commanding Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsunemoto, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Ryofusa, and Asano Kadori to carry out the orders."
"Furthermore, after adding Furu Takaniwa and Yamada Furutsugu, the completion was finally reported on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841) in the 7th year of the Jōwa era."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Suketsuna."
"Following the Nihon Shoki, this text continues from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign, detailing the reigns of Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna."
"In the early 15th century, there were 40 volumes, but they were later lost. It was not until the disciple of Haniho Kiichi, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family (there is also a theory of a revised version by Yanagihara Norimitsu) that it was first published."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, and there is a complete absence of the reign of Emperor Junna."
"By extracting excerpts from works such as ""Nihon Shoki"" and categorizing them into sections in ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" the main text can be partially reconstructed."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"" which collect excerpts from various places, based on which Shueisha translations and Kodansha Academic Bunko publications of Japanese historical materials have been published."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinions of Fujiwara no Tsunetoshi.
"Adding a short biography (obituary) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials is the same as in the ""Nihon Shoki"", following the later historical records."
"However, the obituary of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but rather includes interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, making it unique in the Six National Histories for maintaining a spirit of criticism."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical texts.
Sei Shonagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The daughter of the famous poet Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), who was one of the ""Five Men of the Pear Jar."""
"There is an old tradition that identifies my mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a wild and baseless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become the wives of Gagaku no Kami Narinari, Dazai Sho Kan Chishin, Hanayama-in Denjo Hoshi Kai Shu, and Fujiwara Rino (the siblings of Fujiwara Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a pseudonym, with ""Sei"" taken from the family name Seiwa and ""Shonagon"" taken from a relative's official title."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Shou""), but it is not trustworthy."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection of 42 poems, ""Sei Shonagon Collection"" (the number of poems varies depending on the version, with 31 poems in the circulated version), has been passed down."
"The ""Goshūi Wakashū"" contains 14 poems selected for imperial compilation."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father was the 12th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"The mother is Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"At first he was a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiaki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and went up to Kyoto, where he became the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga, and together with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, they built a coalition to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, he cornered Nobunaga, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi Shogunate was effectively destroyed."
"After that, he spent the rest of his life with the support of Motonari Mori and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was a legitimate child of his older brother, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, I became the adopted child of my maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofuku-ji Ichijo-in), taking the name Kakkei."
He later rose to the rank of Gonsoshi at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku no Hen of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiteru, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Sanjou Sanekata and others, and my brother Ashikaga Shuusou, who was the head priest of Rokuon-in, was also lured to his death."
"At that time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the younger brother of the shogun and was promised the position of head priest of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they kept him imprisoned.)"
"However, with the help of vassals Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Yosimasa, he managed to escape and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name of Yoshiaki."
"In the book that recorded the deeds of Yoshiteru, it is noted that he was also known by the alternate title of ""Buke Gosho"" and others."
"When he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also called ""the poor governor."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Jugoinoge and appointed as Left Head of the Imperial Guard."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Genkishu's ""Genkishu Koki"", it is clear that he had already received the appointment before the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshihide, a rival of Yoshiaki, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568). It is written that Yoshiaki's messenger appeared at Genkishu's residence on the day of the shogun's appointment to Ashikaga Yoshie, who was recommended for promotion to Jusani-shita, asking for mediation, causing confusion."
"Yoshiaki, who had escaped from Kyoto, initially relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshikata and Rokkaku Yoshiharu of Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Three to defect to the domain of Takeda Yoshitsune, who was his sister's husband in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, the Takeda clan in Wakasa did not have enough power to go up to the capital due to succession struggles and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate family."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already had the ""Kuritani Gosho"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and did not have the intention to actively go up to the capital with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, who had just returned to secular life, so the trip to the capital did not materialize."
"Yoshikage Asakura serves as the Kanmuriyaku (Crown Prince). (It should be noted that there are no official historical documents confirming that Yoshiaki had undergone the coming-of-age ceremony up to this point, and it can be said that his coming-of-age ceremony was unusually late for the time.)"
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, she moved to Mino Province and relied on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went up to the capital."
"On October 18, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the imperial court and assumed the position."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank and appointed as a Councilor and Left Guard Captain."
The JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion because the Keihan Kyoto Line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and because it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
The entire section is a double-track line with double tracks in each direction (outer track and inner track).
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-Thru ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system is introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that connect to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan-Hanshin Slow Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Furthermore, nearly half of the local trains will continue on to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR conversion, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train to the Sanin area that started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express began to run through to Kyoto. The number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running to Kyoto as regular trains a year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound Limited Express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains departing from and arriving in Kyoto to Kyushu were completely discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"Furthermore, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that pass through the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka and enter the Hanwa Line enter the freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the limited express and new rapid trains running on the outer line may take slightly longer travel time than the inner line, and there are times when two limited express trains enter at the same time at Shin-Osaka depending on the time of day."
"The track alignment along almost the entire line from Kyoto to Osaka is extremely good, and speeds of up to 130km/h are possible on the outer tracks, with the exception of some curved sections."
"The inner track is also compatible with speeds of up to 120km/h, but there are no express trains running on the inner track (except for transfer or special trains)."
The following limited express trains run on this section.
"In addition, there are transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train),"" ""Tanba (train),"" and ""Hokushin (train)"" running on this section due to the storage and retrieval at Mukaijima-cho (Kyoto General Operating Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train from Mukohara to Osaka for ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" services travels via the Hokuhoku Freight Line."
"When storing the Osaka-bound train at the Kyoto Integrated Operations Center, proceed towards the down direction from Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
Shinkaisoku operates direct services from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Ako/Ago Line Ako direction through JR Kyoto Line to Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station/Tsuruga.
"From daytime to nighttime, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train from Kyoto goes to the Kosei Line, while the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated in 8 or 12 car formations using JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 1000 series and 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard arterial road with a length of approximately 100km, running from Kyotofu Kuse-gun Kumiyama-cho to the city of Miyazu in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"The Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, penetrates through it, strengthening the cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road of the Kyoto metropolitan area, where the high-standard road network is fragile."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections, starting point side, central part, and ending point side, are open, and the starting point side opened under the name of the Kyoto-Jaipur Bypass, not the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the term ""Kyoto Vertical Highway"" is often used to refer specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"Please note that the section between Kuyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed national expressway, so minimum speeds apply and passage of small vehicles such as mopeds is not possible."
"For this reason, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5m are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Public Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the toll-free section."
"The Wachi IC to Amano Kannonji IC section of the Kyoto Tanba Expressway, scheduled to open in the summer to fall of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Amano Kannonji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be under the management of the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current toll-free section from Amano Kannonji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to become a toll road."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and a new Ayabe Angokuji toll booth will be established."
"As a result, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC currently does not have a toll booth, and therefore, there are no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built to be similar to a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanba-wachi IC section is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in the 2014 fiscal year, but the management system after the opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The general national route 9 Oinazaka Kameoka road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and the general national route 9 Kameoka road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"On May 6, 1993, the Tsubakari IC to Chiyogawa IC section was changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: The Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC section began operating as a toll road for the general public."
"March 8, 1998: Ayabe JCT - Maizuru Oe IC opened, connecting to the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (temporary 2 lanes for opposing traffic)."
"On October 1, 2005: With the privatization of four public corporations related to roads, ownership was transferred to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and management was transferred to the West Nippon Expressway Company."
The section with a background color of ■ in the IC number field indicates a road section that is already in use.
"In addition, the parts where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that is not yet open is a tentative name.
Muji has no BS.
The number is for another route.
<Number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire Mt. Hiei with an elevation of 848 meters."
"The mountain is often called Mount Hiei, rather than by its temple's name, Enryaku-ji."
"It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto), so it was also known as Hokurei."
"It is the head temple of the Tendai sect in Japan, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the head of the Tendai sect and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the founding of Kukai, it has been one of the centers of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and insight), and nenbutsu were also practiced, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great influence and was revered by the imperial family and nobility."
"Especially the ritual of empowerment prayer through Esoteric Buddhism gathered the support of the Heian nobility, and the Esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple competed for supremacy against the Esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple in the Shingon sect (To-mitsu), which was called ""Tai-mitsu""."
"The ""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the three towers and sixteen valleys, such as the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokogawa, scattered throughout the area from the summit of Mount Hiei to the eastern foothills."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho founded a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, marking the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was granted to the temple that took the era name of its founding year, which happened in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks and laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, including Ennin, Enchin, the founder of Yuzu Nembutsu Ryōnin, the founder of Jodo Buddhism Hōnen, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Shinran, the founder of Rinzai Zen Eisai, the founder of Soto Zen Dogen, and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism Nichiren. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the nickname ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"Furthermore, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year mountain retreat"" and the ""1,000-day pilgrimage to sacred peaks"" have been continued to the present day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyamazumi no Kami, the landowner deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga District, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15, in the 11th year of the Hoki era (780), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyoho at the Mii-dera Temple in Omi Province, and took the name Saicho."
"At the age of 20, in the fourth year of the Enryaku era (785), I received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a formal monk."
"Shonen Masumi, with his own thoughts, did not seek a stable position in the large temples of Nara, and instead devoted himself to training and studying scriptures on Mount Hiei near his hometown."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the various scriptures, and studied the ""Three Great Sections of the Lotus Sutra"" (Hokke Genki, Hokke Monk, Makashikan) written by the Chinese Tendai master Chigi."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple called Ichijo Shikan-in at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, consisting of Yakushi-do, Monju-do, and Kyozo."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Jogan era (824 AD)."
"Emperor Kammu of the time relied on Saicho, and with the assistance of the Emperor and the influential Waki clan, Mount Hiei Temple gradually prospered as a dojo for national protection, guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas research student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a diplomatic mission ship."
Ennin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of the Tendai monk Doji and the Tendai master Chigi at the sacred site of Mount Hiei.
"In addition, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is commonly believed that the moon is deified and is considered a god that rules over the night, but there are also alternative theories (mentioned later)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"In the Nihon Shoki, there is a story about the killing of Yasakatsumi, so it is generally considered a male god, but there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often portrayed as a goddess, and there are also many goddesses with aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the theory of a goddess, stating that the element of the story of the killing of the moon god Hoshikami cannot be definitively attributed to a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi is said to have been born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and performed purification, along with Amaterasu, who was born from his other eye, and Susanoo, who was born from his nose, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" tells a story that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, opposite to the ""Kojiki,"" and there is also a story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, with her dominion not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in contrast to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (Record of Five Emperors and Three Sovereigns), there is a creation myth that Pangu died and his left eye became the sun, while his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from the sun god Helios, and the identification of the two did not occur until later times."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and night respectively, and to separate light from darkness. This is the creation of the sun and moon that is described."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also believed to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon being born as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally not very active."
"Only briefly mentioned in the fifth volume of the Nihon Shoki, the origin of grains is discussed."
There is a theory that balance is maintained by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationship between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and between Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Umisachi-hiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some people believe in the theory of the same god because Susano'o's domain and episodes overlap in part.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he was born when Izanagi washed his right eye and is known as one of the ""three precious children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi is ordered to ""inform the Night Eating Country"", but after that, there is no further activity."
"There is also a theory that it is the country of Yomimachi, where the god Izanami is."
"In the fifth section of the Age of the Gods in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" it is briefly written that ""the god of the moon, who shines with a radiance second only to the light of the sun, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first book, there is a different account that Izanagi-no-Mikoto gave birth to Obito-no-Mikoto by holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto by holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories that instruct to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu-Omikami in the realm of domination, while there is also a story that commands to control the ebb and flow of the eight hundred layers of the ocean of Sōkaihara (this seems to have originated from the idea that the moon controls the tides), with multiple stories of the birth of three gods running parallel."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukuyomi no Mikoto received an order from Amaterasu to meet with the god of food (Ukemochi) in the heavens and descended to Ukemochi's place."
"In response, the god of food and agriculture spat out rice as an offering, but Tsukiyomi no Mikoto, angered by this, killed the god of food and agriculture with a sword, calling it ""disgusting."" This is a myth."
"From the dead body of the food god, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grain."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) refers to one of the official positions belonging to the Onmyoryo of the Ministry of Central Affairs in ancient Japan under the Ritsuryo system."
"It refers to the position of a technician (official) who performs divination and geomancy based on the philosophy of Yin-Yang Five Elements, and is later assigned to oversee divination, sorcery, and all kinds of rituals beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who perform divination, magic, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times it is defined as a type of clergy who perform private prayers and divination in private."
"Sometimes pronounced as ""onyoji"" without linking sounds."
"It is said that all phenomena are composed of the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology. This ideology originated in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties, and was mostly completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties), or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan during the Asuka period from the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the year 512 when scholars of the Five Classics from Baekje arrived, or by the year 554 when a divination scholar arrived during the reign of Emperor Kinmei."
"Initially, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), Ganroku, who became a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats including Prince Shotoku, which had a significant impact on our country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, Japan began sending envoys to Sui, an advanced civilization, in 607 (15th year of Empress Suiko). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution and the Twelve-Rank Cap and Robe System."
"After that, the court continued to send exchange students with the missions to Sui (later Tang) dynasty, and also invited many monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula or mainland China or port cities for further knowledge absorption."
"As the introduction of various studies advances, it has become important in Japan to consider the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, judge good and bad fortune based on the principles of the interactions of the five elements, and predict the future, and obtain guidance for various matters in life. Therefore, the Yin-Yang and five elements philosophy has come to be emphasized as a strategy to determine good and bad fortune and obtain a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, personally took a divination during the Jinshin War. In 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu), he established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first observatory."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin Yang Five Elements philosophy became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasa-sho (Ministry of Central Affairs) was officially recognized, with positions such as astronomer, onmyoji, calendar expert, and timekeeper appointed as regular officials. Alongside the shrine diviners of the Jingi-kan, they were responsible for conducting official divination ceremonies."
"Those responsible for the technology brought from the continent are skilled in various fields, and they are appointed as advisors to scholars and onmyoji. These individuals are well-versed in Chinese literature and have come from the mainland, specifically from the former Han, later Han, Sui dynasties that held hegemony on the continent, as well as Goguryeo and Baekje which had influence on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. Occasionally, scholars who initially came from Silla, a power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, are also appointed."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of the reign of Emperor Tenji), when Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the downfall of the Baekje Dynasty. Many scholars from Baekje fled as refugees during this period, and a large number of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo at its establishment were purely divination, geomancy (similar to feng shui), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and managing the calendar. They mainly predicted astronomical observations, managed the calendar, and judged the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis rooted in the principles of yin and yang, without performing any religious ceremonies or rituals like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court, as well as in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events like the relocation of the capital."
