"Born in Kyoto, said to be a child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"The diary of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Toboji Kazunaga-kyo-ki,"" entry for August 1st, Meio 3 (1494), reads: ""Secret tradition says that Ikkyu Osho was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and used the aliases Kuang Yunzi, Ka Tsuro, and Mu Kei."
"The Dharma name is Soushun, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(Please refer to the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgai-shūkan of Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being named Shūken."
"His poetic talent emerged early, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at age 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at age 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively determined whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Oei era)."
"Iku received the Dharma name Ikkyū from Haku-sō after answering the koan ""Dōzan's Three Meals of Rice"" with, ""From the world of existence to the world of non-existence, I return. Take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (klesha), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the crow's caw."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing, calling him a fool."

"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono, from the Fushimi-no-miya family, was welcomed to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Go-Hachijo for the throne.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Sōjō, the Most Excellent Monk of the East Sea."""
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyū's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. Though he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) due to the Meiji Restoration's relocation of the capital to Tokyo."
It is also known as Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but it fell into disrepair due to wars and other events, leading to a relocation to the Satouchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Sato Inner Palaces, and it was the residence of the emperors of the Jimyoin line, who would later be known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"Although the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of overseas castles, there is a theory that this reflects the difference in the level of familiarity that commoners have with their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (king) during the French Revolution, by commoners has not occurred in Japan is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of JR Nishi-Nippon Railway's Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo only a decade prior, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its historical appearance."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa performed their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, the enthronement ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the ceremonial throne upon which the Emperor sits during his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. For the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a simple wooden structure, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon gate, you will find the Shishinden directly in front of you."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Bureau of Ceremonial Music of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term refers to all musical pieces performed by the Bureau, excluding Western music."
"Much of it is inherited as court music, primarily in instrumental forms."
It is the oldest musical style in the world still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of gagaku, it was discontinued for over a century after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered descendants of musicians (gakka) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been preserved."
"It is speculated that the singing of hichiriki scores written in katakana, which incorporates the pronunciation characteristics of Japanese before the 16th century, such as pronouncing the ""h"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo,"" faithfully reproduces the original music."
"Many similarities exist between the notation used in the 楽琵琶 and the pipa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, suggesting that both share a common ancestry in an even older continental tradition."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakka family compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, providing valuable documentation of ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music transmitted from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China and is now performed in Japanese gagaku, is believed to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin-yi music (Champa music), are known for their international character, and elements of ancient Japanese music predating the transmission of music from the continent are also included."
"Prior to the modern era, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major musical institutions."
"These musical institutions were later called to Tokyo in the modern era, forming the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces of music are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style Kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) origins."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origins."
These include songs (honkyoku) produced in Japan that imitate the above style.
Songs created during the Heian period (Heian-era songs).
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, *kokufu kabuki* and *yōmono* are collectively referred to as ancient songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of low-born, naturalized origin, making him ineligible for the crown prince position. Initially, he pursued a career in government, serving as a chamberlain, university head, and minister of central affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were suddenly deposed, and he was made Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"The capital was moved to Yamashiro Province, fearing the growing influence of the various Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo."
"Heian-kyō was built in 794, after the construction of Nagaoka-kyō in 784."
They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of Conquest to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship his military endeavors and construction projects imposed on the peasantry."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of cultural aspects."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marred by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, and the exile and death of Prince Sawara, the emperor's younger brother and designated heir, in 785 after he was falsely accused of plotting to assassinate Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the rank of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" imposing confiscations of fiefdoms and other pressures due to their excessive involvement in politics and the wielding of great power."
"It is also said that the disorder within the palace contributed to the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17, 806."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamato-neko-amatsu-hitsugi-iya-deri-no-mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
"He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor, or Tenkoku Oshiharai Miyu Kashiwabara Emperor."
"The mausoleum is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference prior to his birthday, Emperor Akihito stated, in part, regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea based on the record in the *Shoku Nihongi* that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of conversation in the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making leaps in logic."
"The Ōtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakkei, son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hino was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji Temple, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"Both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji era."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned below, in the Otani area, north of the Chion-in Temple in eastern Kyoto."
"Although Honganji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), was considered a force comparable to the warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-Ikki movement, and its head priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honganji"" as in ""Honganji Kannon"" and ""Honganji Kosa,"" this was merely a matter of convenience in addressing them. The head priest's lineage never adopted ""Honganji"" as their family name or surname, and there was no such clan as ""Honganji."""
"Jaku Shinni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ohtani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, the mausoleum of Shinran, became a revered temple for Jodo Shinshu followers as the Ootani Mausoleum, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, was appointed to manage it as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani Temple, attracting pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later became embroiled in a dispute over the absentee position between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Taizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee position by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, has been developing its religious organization. During the Muromachi period, the fifth head priest, Shaknyo, expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh head priest, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working to establish their own organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji Temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a branch temple of the Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its eighth head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province and then to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki erupted in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect in Kaga effectively governed, leading to a state known as ""the country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was effectively ruled by the Ikkō-shū sect."
"Entering the 16th century, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, wielding its organizational strength from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, moved to the Ishiyama Goho, established by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and renamed it Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a vital hub for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo secured the temple's power base by forging close relationships with various lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some within the Honganji sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central authority of Honganji and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji Buddhist sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and seeking to seize territorial power from religious forces to establish unified rule."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji gain the upper hand through the combined efforts of Kannon and his followers entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple and the widespread resistance movement against the Oda clan. This significantly hampered Nobunaga's ambitions."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, which had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, among other local resistances. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, suffered a naval defeat at the Battle of Kizu River against the Oda navy, marking a series of defeats outside the Honganji Temple."
"Despite maintaining strength by gathering support from groups like the Saika, Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to abandon Ishiyama Hongan-ji. With this, Hongan-ji's power as a territorial lord ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyo-nyo, the eldest son, argued for continuing resistance against the wishes of Ken-nyo, leading to a rift between them. When Ken-nyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Jun-nyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point, the Hongan-ji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, creating the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple, separate from the Hongan-ji Temple led by Kyo-nyo."
"At this time, many followers from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in a split of the Honganji temple into east and west."
"The heads of the two major Ootani families, descended from Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Ariyasu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), traditionally adopted sons of powerful court nobles. Moreover, they continued to intermarry with court nobles generation after generation, leading to further integration into the court nobility through their maternal lineage."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It is situated in the central part of the triangular region of the three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, flowing north-south on the east side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are largely considered bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), became a city, formerly Tsuzuki District, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuchiya District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the addition of ""Kyoto"" from ""Kyo"" in Kyoto Prefecture. The town-to-city conversion (city implementation) and the renaming of ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" were both implemented on the same day."
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is thriving, with Gyokuro as a specialty product."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008 - Bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamajiro-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Delivery area also includes neighboring Itecho, Tsuzuki District)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keishin East Rose Town."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the time of its municipal incorporation.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While there is a ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii,"" the old province name of Wakayama, in the station name located in Tanabe City is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces of the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama and Tokyo Prefectures, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, provincial governor rank classification, remote province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a walled city built on the border of the two counties of Kadono and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was laid out in a rectangular shape, measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the heart of the city, dividing the city into left and right districts (the east being the left district and the west being the right district)."
"The floor plan essentially follows Heijokyo, emulating the Sui and Tang Chang'an."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony,"" derived from Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyo area was smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Southern Limit of the Ninth Avenue is currently the Kujo Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
"The easternmost road in Tokyo, Tokyo Kyokudairo, corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori."
The estimated location of the Nishikyogoku-Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishikyogoku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""条"" (jō), and a column of four towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊"" (bō)."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for a small lane, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for a main road."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters).
"Also, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-Horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi-Horikawa) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to establish a new capital under the reign of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Emperor Tenmu lineage was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyo's construction."
"The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi), followed by the construction of the city (Kyō)."
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), and therefore, it did not become urbanized until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely obsolete, the capital was so dilapidated that land within its boundaries was even being converted to farmland, a practice strictly forbidden within the city."
"Noble residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD, Japan), it records a period of 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the year 819, Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"Three, excluding the heir apparent, died while the matter remained unfinished, so later Emperor Junwa issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Nao-yo-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, entrusting Fujiwara no Tsugushi, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Shikatori with its execution."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada Koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and Fujiwara no Otsugu was the only one who was involved in the project throughout the three generations of emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued,"" this text records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"It originally comprised 40 volumes, but was scattered after the early 15th century. It was first published when Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of Handa  Takumi, discovered 10 volumes of manuscript copies at the Sanjo-nishi family (although some say it was a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu)."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Emperor Kanmu), 14 and 17 (Emperor Heijo), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Emperor Saga), totaling ten volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the *Nihon Kiryaku*, an abridged version of the *Six National Histories*, and the *Ruijū Kokushi*, a categorized index of the *Six National Histories*, by referencing citations from both works."
"There are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun"" which are collections of various historical anecdotes, and based on these, the following publications are available: Iwanami Shoten's Annotated Japanese Historical Materials and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
It is said that the content most reflects the views of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of including brief biographies (kōden) in the death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent set by the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the biography in this book does not fall into the trap of one-sided, official praise or condemnation. Instead, it features many interesting descriptions that incorporate unique critiques and observations, making it a rare example of a work in the Six National Histories that maintains a critical spirit."
"It is also known that the Rikkokushi, compared to other historical texts before and after it, included a large number of waka poems."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some say her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in ""The Second Anthology of Japanese Poetry"" as ""Higaki no Ouna,"" but this is nothing more than a fantastical and unfounded theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are siblings, including the Head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, a letter writer, the Buddhist priest Kaishu of the Flower Mountain Palace, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name is a court title, ""Sei"" derived from the surname Kiyohara and ""Shonagon"" from a family position."
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, like the ""Makura no Soshi"" (Pillow Book), claim it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is not credible."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Anthology of Sei Shonagon,"" is extant (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most widely circulated version contains 31 poems)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe  Nagahiro."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He had originally been a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"And, he ascended to Kyoto under the protection of Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and became the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle Nobunaga."
"Though they briefly cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga Shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending its reign."
He later spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537 (Tenbun 6), the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji) as a foster child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Shukō, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of abbot of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they confined him instead of killing him.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and was said to have been attacked by night thieves, earning him the nickname ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jushi-ge and appointed as the Left Horse Superintendent."
"However, while there are doubts about the date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's messenger came to his residence to request mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to the rank of Jushiinoge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed prior to this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to Wakasa Province in August, seeking shelter with his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitaka."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his aid in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at his side, and he was not interested in actively marching to Kyoto with the newly-resigned Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the plan to go to Kyoto never came to fruition."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (Note, there is no historical record of Yoshiaki having officially come of age at this point, and it can be said that his coming of age was far too late for the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as a Councilor and Middle General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodo River's right bank, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
It is a double-double track with separate directions for the outer and inner tracks throughout the entire section.
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line Operation Management System.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"The line also serves as a route for express trains, rapid trains, and local trains that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically as overnight express trains to Kyushu that had originated in Shin-Osaka, limited express trains to the Kii Peninsula that had originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began service after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all began running through to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto within a year.  The New Osaka - Kyoto route has become a corridor of express trains, with about four departures per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka, enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (Platform 3) and pass through Suita Signal Box before arriving at Shin-Osaka."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains running on the outer tracks in the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with the outer tracks capable of 130 km/h operation except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also designed for 120 km/h, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, freight trains for ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" services, related to the entry and exit of trains at Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot), run on this section."
"Furthermore, the ""Thunderbird"", ""Raicho"", and ""Kitaguni"" service trains between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is brought into Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges into the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is taken when the train leaves the depot.)"
"Therefore, when running in and out of the depot, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Amagasaki and Kami-Gori on the Sanyo Line, and Banshu-Akō on the Akō Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Omi-Shiotsu on the Hokuriku Line, and Tsuruga."
"From noon to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one daytime service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four trains run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
All trains operate with 8 or 12 cars using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway (Kyoto Jukan Expressway), a 100km long high-standard expressway (National Route 478), runs from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, it strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, revitalizes the region, and serves as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the ending point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, it is often the case that the Kyoto-Tanba Road is referred to as the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"The main line portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc., is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  At the same time, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section, Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC does not have a toll booth. This eliminates all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Route 9 Old Nozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was changed from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Ooe IC (provisional 2-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The background color of the IC number field is ■ for sections of road that are in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei, 848 meters above sea level, as its grounds."
"Though known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei, or simply Eizan, is more commonly referred to as such."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"The head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongobuji Temple."
"Besides the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, it also practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land Buddhism, presenting the image of a comprehensive Buddhist university. It gained great influence during the Heian period, earning the respect of the Imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist practices, known as ""kaji-kito,"" gained support among the Heian aristocracy, with the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple (Shingon sect) known as ""To-mitsu"" and that of Enryakuji Temple known as ""Dai-mitsu,"" vying for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji is a collective term for the temples and pagodas scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and other structures."
It began in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which takes its name from the era in which it was founded, was only granted in 824, the 14th year of the Kōnin era, after Saichō's death."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen Buddhism, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen Buddhism, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism.  Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the title of ""The Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous practices such as the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and the ""Thousand-Day Peak Pilgrimage"" continue to this day, making it a prominent sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times, and the Hie Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, for reasons of his own, chose not to seek a stable position at a great temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, near his hometown, devoting himself to training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Commentary on the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the present site of the Hokkedo, naming it Ichijo Jikan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and it was only after the death of Saicho, in the year 824 (弘仁 14), that it was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the name of the era."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national defense center against evil spirits, guarding the north-eastern gate of Kyoto."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a gengakushō, a short-term overseas trainee."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804.
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Moreover, he studied esoteric Buddhism from the master Shunkyo at the Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing), and Zen from the master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, alternative interpretations exist (discussed later)."
The name is also read as Tsukiyomi.
"While the Kojiki mentions the slaying of the food deity, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the text itself does not contain any descriptions that definitively establish its gender."
"In many foreign mythologies, the moon deity is often a goddess, and many other mythologies feature aggressive female deities. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male deity, supporting the theory that the deity was female."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" presents a different account, claiming Amaterasu was born from the left eye, not the right, and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand.  Furthermore, the extent of her dominion varies, encompassing heaven, the sea, and other undefined realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, the sun goddess, reflects a concept found in various mythologies, as comparative mythology highlights."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the universal creation myth of the sun and moon being born as a pair.
"Despite being considered a significant deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall role is rather limited."
"Only briefly, in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" is the origin of grains mentioned."
"There is also a theory that this balances out by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, two gods with contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in the case of Amenominakanushi no Kami for Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri for Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [the other deity] are the same god, as their domains and stories overlap in part."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity, born from Izanagi's washing of his right eye, is known as one of the ""Three Noble Children,"" alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""inform the land of food at night,"" but there are no further accounts of his deeds."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo-ki simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose radiance rivaled that of the sun, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book of the Kojiki states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While there are several stories where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, there are also accounts where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" seemingly stemming from the belief that the moon controls the tides. This results in a parallel existence of multiple narratives regarding the birth of the three deities."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth section of the Chronicles, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Ukemochi, the Food Goddess, in the heavens. He descended to meet her."
"There is a myth that the food goddess, in an act of hospitality, vomited rice from her mouth, and the moon god, Tsukiyomi, angered by this, killed her with his sword."
"From the corpse of the Grain God, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji was a government position in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system, belonging to the Onmyōryō under the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"The official position, originally assigned to practitioners of divination and geomancy based on the principles of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, later expanded beyond the original legal regulations to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"After the medieval period, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sound ""n""."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are formed by combinations of these principles. This philosophy, along with its closely related fields of astronomy, calendar, divination, and timekeeping, was transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or indirectly through the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 AD (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when divination scholars arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little impact on politics and culture, in 602 AD, Kanroku, considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, significantly influencing the nation's governance."
"The first official adoption of a calendar (Genka calendar) in Japan occurred, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, began to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendrical methods. The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy is also evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility."
"Thereafter, the court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the west coast of the Korean peninsula, where the envoys stopped, to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to understand the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, interpreting their implications based on the principles of the Five Elements (五行) theory, to predict fortune and misfortune and obtain guidance for all aspects of life. This led to the prominence of Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory as a means to determine auspiciousness and establish behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, renowned for his mastery of celestial divination and the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, even using the *shi* (a divination tool) during the Jinshin War, established the *Onmyōryō* (Bureau of Yin-Yang) and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the growing popularity of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy. In 718, the Yōrō Code formally established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, and stipulated that it be staffed by permanent officials such as the Astronomer, Onmyōji Doctor, Onmyōji, Calendar Doctor, and Clepsydra Doctor. This officially placed them alongside the Shinto priests' divination through tortoise shell as the official practitioners of divination."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as specialists, and among them were scholars who had returned from the mainland, proficient in various fields and skilled in reading classical Chinese. These scholars included those who had been to the Former Han, Later Han, Sui, which had taken over the mainland hegemony, Goguryeo and Baekje, which had power on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and rarely, Silla, which was initially a power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly, in the aftermath of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, resulting in a defeat and the subsequent unification of the Korean peninsula by Silla and the fall of the Baekje dynasty, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees. Many of them were appointed to official positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Liao's technical expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern-day Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and clepsydra.  They primarily engaged in astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on Yin Yang and Five Elements principles.  They did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks.  However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the court, and in divining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and directions, making them vital during the relocation of the capital."
