<AA+> is the second highest of 21 rankings.
"It ranks among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."

"Furthermore, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" are proposed as concrete means to realize this ""conscience"" education, aiming to cultivate individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation."""
"A Christian Protestant school corporation, descended from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, unlike so-called mission schools, it does not prioritize Christian evangelism (it does not use education as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded Doshisha English School in Marutamachi, Teramachi-dori, Kyoto."
Moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa in 1876.
Doshisha Branch School Women's Department was established in April 1877 and renamed Doshisha Girls' School in September.
1883: Doshisha established its rules.
"In 1888, the intention to establish Doshisha University was announced in major newspapers and magazines nationwide."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"For ""Ikkyū-san's頓知咄"", see the entry for ""Ikkyū-dō"" (this page also has some information). For the TV anime ""Ikkyū-san"", see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san""."
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
The secret tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu.
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kacu-ro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Image-External Collection of Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being named Zhou Jian."
"He showed exceptional poetic talent from a young age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415."
"Iku received the Dharma name Ikkyū from Haku-sō after answering the koan ""Dōzan's Three Meals of Rice"" with the words, ""From the realm of existence to the realm of non-existence, I return. Take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (煩悩), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (仏)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the cawing of a crow."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
He sent the fool away with a laugh.
"Thereafter, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verses, calligraphy, painting, and eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono, from the Fushimi-no-miya family, was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Go-Hachijo for the throne.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Sōjō, the Most Esteemed Monk of the East Sea."""
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyū's recommendation played no role."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. Although he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but due to wars and other calamities, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Court moved to the Sato-no-Uchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Sato Inner Palaces, and it was the residence of the emperors of the Jimyoin line, who later became known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present day (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the nearby Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of overseas castles, some argue that this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity between the common people and their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (king) during the French Revolution, by commoners has not occurred in Japan is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the ""Sato-no-Uchi"" (inner palaces), known as ""Tsuchimikado Higashi no Toin-dono."" It was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved the Imperial Palace to Tokyo only a decade earlier, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered its preservation and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, when the current Emperor ascended the throne, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor where he sits during his enthronement, signifying his accession, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a plain wooden frame, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or for public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, a mark of the highest status for a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down in the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term refers to all musical pieces performed by the Department of Music, excluding Western music."
Much of it is preserved as instrumental music in court music.
It is the oldest musical style in the world to be still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of Gagaku, it was discontinued for over a hundred years after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been preserved."
"It is speculated that the singing of a hichiriki score written in katakana, with its 16th-century Japanese pronunciation features such as the ""ha"" sound being pronounced as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo,"" faithfully reproduces the original music."
"The notation used in the Raku Biwa, written in kanji, shares many similarities with the Biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and suggests a strong inheritance from ancient continental styles."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakusha family compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, centered on the shō, providing valuable documentation of ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music that came from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China and is now performed in Japanese gagaku, is believed to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music), reveal a vibrant international character, suggesting that elements of ancient Japanese music predating the introduction of music from the continent were also present."
"Prior to the modern era, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Dai-uchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha (Nara) were considered the three major musical institutions."
"These musical institutions were later called to Tokyo in the modern era, forming the basis of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are inherited by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style song and dance.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) origins."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin."
These include songs (honkyoku) produced in Japan that imitate the above style.
Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono).
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, ""Koku-fu Kabuki"" and ""Yōmon"" are collectively referred to as ""Ancient Songs."""
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinryo, was of humble origins, a naturalized clan of the Wa clan. As a result, he was not expected to become crown prince and initially sought advancement as an official, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the middle affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed. On January 2, 773, he was declared Crown Prince."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, Heijo-kyo was constructed in 784, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built anew."
They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of Conquest to invade the Tohoku region and subdue the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the suffering inflicted on the peasantry by such military and construction projects."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of culture."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, and was also marked by the dark event of the exile and death of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince. Prince Sawara was banished in 785 on charges of assassinating Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the position of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too powerful through their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial palace was a contributing factor to the later ""Yakushi no Hen"" incident."
"Died on March 17, 806."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi-iya-deri-no-Mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku Oshiharai no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The tomb is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three shrines within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference prior to his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of discussion in the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making significant leaps in logic."
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hino was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji Temple, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum at the Otani site, north of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"During the Sengoku period (Japan), Hongan-ji Temple, with its influence on the Ikko-ikki movement, became a force comparable to the warlords, leading to its inclusion among them. The temple's head priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Hongan-ji,"" as in ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosuke."" However, this was purely for convenience; the Hongan-ji head priest lineage never adopted ""Hongan-ji"" as their family name or surname, and there was no ""Hongan-ji"" clan."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became a revered temple for Jodo Shinshu followers, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, was appointed to manage it as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani Temple, attracting pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the position of absentee abbot between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and his half-brother Yuisen. Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee abbot position by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, developed its religious organization. During the Muromachi period, the fifth head priest, Shaknyo, expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh head priest, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working on establishing their own organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji Temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as a kind of steward for the Kujo family."
"In the late 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its eighth head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect of Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, wielding its organizational strength from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as the Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the summit of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a vital hub for river transportation at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo strengthened the temple's power base by forging close ties with various lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some within the Honganji sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central authority of Honganji and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and seeking to establish unified rule by seizing territorial power from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand through the combined efforts of Kannon and his followers, who fortified themselves in Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the temple's followers who resisted Oda forces throughout the land. This posed a significant challenge to Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, suppressing resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own territory."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple continued to garner support from groups like the Saika-shu and remained strong, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to abandon Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple. With this, Hongan-ji Temple ceased to exist as a territorial power."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point onward, the Hongan-ji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the East Hongan-ji Temple, separate from the Hongan-ji Temple led by Kyo-nyo."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyojo's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in a split between the two temples."
"The heads of the two major Ootani families, descended from Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have traditionally adopted sons from powerful court noble families. They have also consistently intermarried with court nobles, leading to a gradual increase in their own court noble lineage through their maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It sits at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River flowing north-south on the east side of the city and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, it is traversed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line in its center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are strongly characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment) with the prefix ""Kyo"" from Kyoto Prefecture. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is thriving, with Gyokuro as a specialty product."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamaki-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Adjacent Itecho, Tsuzuki District is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is also served by ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line.
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the time of its municipal incorporation.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While the Kii Tanabe Station (Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the inclusion of ""Kii,"" the former province name of Wakayama, in the station's name is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces established under the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama Prefecture, the eastern part of Tokyo excluding the Sumida River and islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, provincial governor rank classification, remote province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a walled city built on the border of the two counties of Kadono and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was laid out in a rectangular shape, measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing the city into the Left Capital (east) and the Right Capital (west)."
The floor plan basically follows Heijokyo and imitates Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties.
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony"" (Sishin Souou), derived from Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyo area was smaller than present-day Kyoto city.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Southern Limit of the Ninth Avenue is today's Kujo Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Grand Avenue corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the Nishikyogoku-Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishikyogoku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east-west (excluding the two on the northern edge) is called a ""条"", and a column of four towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for a small lane, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for a main road."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters).
"Also, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi-horikawa River) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to establish a new capital under the reign of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Emperor Tenmu lineage was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyō's construction."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"The right bank of Kyoto, being a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), remained largely undeveloped even in the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely obsolete, the capital city was so desolate that farmland, which was originally forbidden within its boundaries, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"Noble residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records the 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the year 819, Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three others, excluding Otsugu, died with the task unfinished, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Nao-yo Wang, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minemori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, entrusting the execution to Fujiwara no Tsugushi, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Shikatori."
"Later, adding Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and Fujiwara no Otsugu alone was involved in the project throughout the reigns of three emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued,"" this text records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the collection was scattered by the early 15th century. It was rediscovered in the Sanjo-nishi family by Inayama Gyokyo, a student of Handa Hokiichi, who found 10 volumes in manuscript form (though some argue it was discovered as a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu). This rediscovery led to the first publication of the work."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories,"" and the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" a categorized compilation of the ""Six National Histories,"" by referencing their citations."
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes from various sources, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun,"" which have been the basis for the publications of ""Shueisha Yaku-chu Nihon Shiryo"" and ""Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."""
It is said that the content most reflects the opinions of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of attaching short biographies (kōden) to death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent of the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the biography in this book does not fall into the usual one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique critiques and impressions, making it an anomaly among the Six National Histories for its persistence of critical spirit."
"It is also known that the ""Six National Histories"" included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical works."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five famous poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in the ""Gosenshu Wakashu"" as ""Higaki no Ouna,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are siblings, including the Head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Assistant Minister of the Left, a letter writer, the Buddhist priest Kaiju of the Flower Mountain Palace, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name, a lady-in-waiting, is said to be derived from her family name, Kiyohara, and the title of a relative, ""Shonagon."""
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, such as the ""Makura no Soshi,"" suggest it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is not credible."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collection of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most widely circulated version contains 31 poems) has been passed down."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe  Nagahiro."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He had initially been a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other court officials."
"He then ascended to the throne as the 15th Shogun, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle Nobunaga."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga Shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending its reign."
He then spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537, the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji) as a foster child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Shukō, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, as he was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple's chief priest in the future, so they only confined him.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by alternative names, such as ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was driven from Kyoto and was attacked by night thieves, and is said to have been called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jushi no ge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed to the post of Sama no kami (Master of the Horse)."
"However, while there are doubts about the date of his appointment, according to Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's messenger appeared at his residence and requested his mediation for a promotion to the rank of Jushiinoge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son, Takeda Yoshitaka in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at his side, and he had no intention of actively marching to Kyoto with the newly-returned-to-lay-life Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the march to Kyoto did not happen."
"The role of capping was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there are no historical records of Yoshiaki having formally come of age at this point, making his coming of age exceptionally late for the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Councillor and Middle General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and it is designated as the main line, along with the JR Kobe Line, so the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodo River's right bank, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
It is a quadruple-track line with separate quadruple tracks for each direction (outer and inner lines).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru ICOCA, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) Suica, Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates as an integrated service with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line also serves as a route for rapid, express, and local trains connecting the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically, with the introduction of overnight express trains to Kyushu that originated in Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula that originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began operating after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all extending their routes to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later.  The New Osaka - Kyoto line has become a ""expressway"" with about four express trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and others."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, as part of the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line depart from the third platform at Ibaraki Station, enter the freight line, and then proceed to Shin-Osaka via the Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express trains and rapid trains that run on the outer lines on the same section, and sometimes two express trains enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with the outer tracks capable of 130 km/h operation except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling 120 km/h trains, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also empty trains such as the ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" running on this section for entering and leaving the Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains run on the Hokubu Freight Line between Mukomachi and Osaka during their deadhead runs."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka Station, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, when running in and out of the depot, the formation is reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Amagasaki and Kamigori on the Sanyo Line, and Banshu-Akō on the Akō Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Ōmi-Shiotsu Station on the Hokuriku Line, and Tsuruga."
"From noon to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one daytime service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
All trains operate with 8 or 12 cars using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100 km from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City in the same prefecture, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478)."
"It traverses the long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening the connection between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, revitalizing the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the ending point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, it is often the case that the Kyoto-Tanba Road is referred to as the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"The mainline portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc., is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita-Honsen Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section, Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita-Honsen toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll plaza will be established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. This will eliminate all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinonosaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT - Maizuru Ooe IC section (provisional 2-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections of road that are in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the schedule number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, with its grounds encompassing the entire Mount Hiei, which stands at 848 meters above sea level."
"While known as Enryaku-ji Temple, it is more often called Mount Hiei, or Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The Chief Priest (Head Priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobu-ji Temple."
"It practiced the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land Buddhism, becoming a comprehensive university of Buddhism. During the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial family and nobility, acquiring significant influence."
"In particular, esoteric rituals and prayers gained support among the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple, known as ""Taimitsu,"" competed with the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple, known as ""To-mitsu,"" of the Shingon sect."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective term for the numerous halls and pagodas scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, and Yokawa."
It began in 788 when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which takes its name from the era in which it was founded, was only granted in 824, fourteen years after Saicho's death, during the Jōnin era."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, leading to the temple being called the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous practices such as the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and the ""Thousand-Day Peak Pilgrimage"" continue to this day, making it a prominent sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times.  The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"Young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, chose not to seek a secure position in the great temples of Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, near his hometown, dedicating himself to rigorous training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the present location of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the era name, was granted only after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the Jōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national sanctuary to protect Kyoto from evil spirits in the north-east."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a ""Gengakushō,"" a short-term overseas student."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804 AD.
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Moreover, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from the abbot Shunkyo at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing) and Zen from the Zen master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, there are alternative interpretations (discussed later)."
"The name is also read as ""Tsukiyomi."""
"Although the Kojiki contains a story of the slaying of the food deity, Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the chronicles do not contain any descriptions that definitively determine its gender."
"Many moon deities in other cultures are goddesses, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and they support the theory that the deity was a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the *Nihon Shoki* presents a different account, claiming that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, not the right, and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The text also varies in its description of her dominion, mentioning both heaven and the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, is a concept found in various mythologies, as pointed out in the field of comparative mythology."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the universal myth of the sun and moon being born as a pair, a common motif found throughout the world."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall activity is limited."
"Only briefly, in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" is the origin of grains mentioned."
There is also a theory that this balances the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo by placing a god who does nothing between them.
"Similar structures are also found in the relationship between Amenominakanushi no Kami and Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and in the relationship between Hosuseri and Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [the other deity] are the same god, as their domains and some of their stories overlap."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""inform the land of food at night,"" but he has no further exploits after this."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo section simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose brilliance rivaled the sun's, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the first book of the Kojiki states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While there are several stories where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, there are also accounts where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tides of the vast ocean."" This latter story seems to stem from the belief that the moon controls the tides, and multiple creation myths of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the fifth section, the eleventh book of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Ukemochi, the Food Goddess, in the heavens. He descended and went to Ukemochi."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as a gesture of hospitality, offered food from her mouth, which angered Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto, who then killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the Grain Deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to grains."
"Onmyōji, a term referring to a government official in ancient Japan, belonged to the Onmyōryō, a department within the Ministry of Central Affairs under the Ritsuryō system."
"The position of a technical officer who, based on the philosophy of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, performed divination and geomancy through Yin-Yang Dao, and later came to oversee all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals, exceeding the original provisions of the Ritsuryo code."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sound of ""n"" being elided."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are constituted by combinations of these principles. This philosophy, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendrical systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping, was transmitted to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 CE (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when I Ching scholars arrived."
"Although the initial influence of these studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD, Kanroku, considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, significantly impacting the nation's governance."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), envoys were sent to Sui, a leading civilization, to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendrical methods. The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought is also evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the envoys stopped, to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to determine good fortune, misfortune, and disaster based on the principles of the Five Elements theory of mutual generation and mutual overcoming, thereby predicting the future and obtaining guidance for all aspects of human affairs."" As a result, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of judging auspiciousness and inauspiciousness and obtaining guidelines for behavior."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of celestial divination and deeply versed in the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, even using divination by the ""shi"" during the Jinshin War, established the ""Onmyōryō"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the growing influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought. In 718, the Yōrō Code officially established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Onmyōji, calendar experts, and clock experts, alongside the Shinto priests who conducted divination using tortoise shells. This formalized the role of Onmyōji in official divination."
"Only those skilled in techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as doctors and Onmyoji, and they were invariably immigrants who were well-versed in various disciplines and proficient in reading classical Chinese. These included scholars who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui, which had replaced them as the dominant power on the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje, which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally Silla, which was initially a power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Especially in the aftermath of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, resulting in Baekje's defeat and Silla's unification of the Korean peninsula, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees. Many of them were appointed to government positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Office's expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern ""Feng Shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the operation of clepsydras.  They primarily engaged in astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on Yin Yang and Five Elements principles.  They did not engage in religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the court, and in determining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and directions, making them essential during relocation of the capital."
