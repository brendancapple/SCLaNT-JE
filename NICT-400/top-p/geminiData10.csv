"The Dharma name is Soshu, also written as Sosun."
Ikkū is a dharma name.
"Please see ""Kaimyo"" for information regarding Buddhist names."
"He entered Ankokuji's Zōgai Shūkan at the age of six, received the precepts, and was given the name Zhou Jian."
"His exceptional talent for poetry emerged early, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at age 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at age 15 garnered acclaim and praise throughout Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ou Soui and changed his monastic name to Soujun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively determined whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kassō Sōdon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415."
"Ikyu received the Dharma name from Hasso after answering the koan “Dongshan's Three Meals with a Stick” with ""Return from the realm of existence to the realm of non-existence. Take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji (Avaroja)"" refers to the world of delusion (klesha), while ""Muroji (Avaroja)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."

"Afterwards, he lived a life of poetry, comic verses, calligraphy, painting, and eccentricities."
"In 1428, Emperor Shokō died childless, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended Emperor Go-Hachijo's ascension to the throne.
"From ""The Chronicle of the Monk Ikkyū of Tōkai""."
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's consent and that Ikkū's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In the 6th year of Bunmei (1474), after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the chief priest (47th) of Daitokuji Temple by the order of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. He did not reside at the temple but devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It was preserved in 1877, following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) due to the Meiji Restoration's relocation to Tokyo."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyō was the Inner Palace, located near the center of the city. However, due to wars and other disasters, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Court moved to the Sato Inner Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace, one of the Sato Inner Palaces, was the Imperial Palace where successive emperors of the Jimyoin lineage, later known as the Northern Court, resided."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would come to be known as the Southern Court, was located in the Nijo-Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Palace, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Normally, participation requires registration, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present era (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, being state-owned property."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and separated by Imadegawa-dori to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both with their Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Dairi, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto residents often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While unlike European castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high, some argue that this reflects a different sense of closeness between the people and their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch, by commoners during the French Revolution has not occurred in Japan is one piece of evidence supporting this analysis."
"The Imperial Palace in the early days of Heian-kyo was significantly west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, situated in the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the West Japan Railway Nijo Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the “sato-dairi” known as “Tsuchimikado Higashi-Toin-Dono,” and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era in the style of the Heian period."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo just ten years prior, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had already fallen into disrepair. He ordered its preservation and maintenance to maintain its historical appearance."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryo-den, Kogosho, Gokakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshu, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the Imperial Household Law enacted in 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijo-sai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa held their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. The enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, which took place in 1990, was the first to be held in the Tokyo Imperial Palace."
"The Takamikura, the symbolic throne upon which the Emperor sits during his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's Enthronement Ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (corresponding to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-post gate with a plain wooden frame, gable roof, cypress bark shingles, and a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, or state guests, or for public events."
"There are five horizontal lines on the two earthen walls, signifying the highest level of formality."
"Entering this gate and passing through the vermilion-tiled Jo-mei Gate, the Shi-shin-den is directly in front."
"Gagaku is a type of traditional music from Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
"This paper focuses on Japanese gagaku (an Important Intangible Cultural Property), primarily as it is preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and proper music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term refers to all music performed by the department, excluding Western music."
It is primarily inherited as court music in instrumental works.
It is the oldest musical style in the world still performed in large ensembles.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form, Gagaku ceased to exist for over a century after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate reassembled the descendants of musicians (Gakke)  Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form is still preserved."
"This suggests a fairly faithful reproduction, possibly even preserving 16th-century pronunciation features, like using ""fafi fu fe fo"" for the ""ha"" sound when singing the hichiriki notation."
"There are many similarities between the notation on the 楽琵琶 and the pipa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and many older continental styles are still preserved in the 楽琵琶."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai gensho,"" written by Toyohara Nobuyaki (1450-1512) out of concern for the loss of records of Gagaku music and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū, a member of the Shō Gakka, compiled a chronicle of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, providing a valuable record of gagaku from an earlier era."
"It is derived from ceremonial music that originated in China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, said to have been transmitted from China, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese Gagaku, is believed to be based on the music played at banquets during the Tang Dynasty known as Yanle."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music), are internationally diverse, and include elements of ancient Japanese music predating the introduction of music from the continent."
"In pre-modern times, the Tennoji Gakuso of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Ouchi Gakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were designated as the Three Great Musical Ensembles."
"These musical societies, while being brought to Tokyo in the modern period and forming the basis for the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music club, continue to preserve their respective traditions in their original locations."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 songs are passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to the S-State style of dance-drama.
Things that were transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this alone to be the definition of gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, and Lâm Ấp (South Vietnamese) influences."
"Right-side dance, Koryo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin."
These include songs created in Japan (Honkyoku) that emulate the above style.
Songs created in the Heian period (utailmono).
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, both ""Koku-fu Kabuki"" and ""Yōmon"" are collectively referred to as ""Ancient Songs."""
Emperor Kanmu (737 AD - 806 AD) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born in 737 as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin).
"The Chronicle of Japan records that Mother Takano's new cap was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing its ancestry back to King Muryeong of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Andon (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko bore Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-gasa, was from the lowly naturalized clan, Wa, making him ineligible for the crown. Initially, he aimed for a career in the bureaucracy and held positions like Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political struggles involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and he was established as Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"The capital was moved to Yamashiro Province, fearing the growing influence of various Nara Buddhist temples in Heijō-kyō."
"Initially, in 784, they built Nagaoka-kyo, but in 794, they constructed Heian-kyo anew."
"They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, as the Great General of the Conquest, to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the military and construction projects that burdened the peasants."
He is said to have initiated the compilation of the _Shoku Nihongi_ in terms of cultural aspects.
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang Dynasty China, bringing fresh ideas and a new wave of influence to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess To, and was also marred by the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's brother and designated heir, who was banished on charges of plotting the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane-tsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's grave was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the rank of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Nan-tō Rokushū,"" which were various Buddhist sects that had grown too powerful by engaging in politics, by confiscating their estates and applying other pressures."
"It is also said that the chaos within the imperial palace at that time contributed to the later ""Incident of Yakushi,"" creating a breeding ground for it."
"Died on March 17th, 806."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamatonekoamatsuhitsugiya derino Mikoto.
"Along with it, he was posthumously bestowed the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu."
"He was also known as Emperor Kashiwabara and Emperor Kashiwabara, the Heavenly Ruler who Subdued and Governed the Universe."
"The tomb is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"Though he had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, due to the results of divination, he was interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"Moreover, all emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three sanctuaries in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in a customary press conference before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in his comments about the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, remarked, “I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea in light of the record in the *Shoku Nihongi* that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje.”"
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of discussion in the Korean media."
"Some reports, however, jumped to conclusions with claims like ""the Imperial family is of Korean descent"" and ""the Imperial family originates from Baekje."""
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of Honganji, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"In the Meiji era, both the chief priest of the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) and the chief priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hombyo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The surname Ōtani originates from the location of the temple dedicated to Shinran, which was established in Ōtani, north gate of Chion-in temple in eastern Kyoto."
"Though the Hongan-ji Temple, due to its influence during the Sengoku period (Japan) as the foundation of the Ikko-ikki movement, was powerful enough to be counted among the Sengoku Daimyo, the temple's head priest was often referred to by their Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) or personal name with ""Honganji"" attached, such as ""Honganji Kannon"" or ""Honganji Kossu."" This, however, is merely a convenient way of naming, as the lineage of the Honganji head priests never adopted ""Honganji"" as their family name, and a family name like ""Honganji-shi"" never existed."
"Kakushinni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Otani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, a temple dedicated to Shinran, became the revered Ootani Mausoleum for the followers of Jodo Shinshu, and Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, was appointed as the caretaker."
"However, the Otani temple attracted pilgrims and donations from across the country, leading to a dispute over the position of absentee abbot between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Yuizen, Kakkei's half-brother.  Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee abbot position by his lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the temple into a monastery, giving birth to the Otani Hongwanji."
"Since then, the Hongwanji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo,  advanced in forming a religious organization.  During the Muromachi period, under the fifth generation, Shakanyo, the temple expanded into the Hokuriku region.  By the time of the seventh generation, Jonyo, Hongwanji temples had been established in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working to establish temples since the death of Shinran, the formation of a temple for this lineage was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji Temple was considered a branch temple of Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as a kind of steward for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, then later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki (peasant uprising) occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where Kaga became known as a ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was effectively ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century began, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, employing its organizational strength encompassing everything from small farmers to low-ranking samurai and local lords, saw its activities flourish throughout Japan. However, the Yamaoka Honganji suffered a fire during the Tenmon-Hokke Rebellion in 1532. The 10th head priest, Jonyo, moved to the Ishiyama Gofuku-ji temple in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka), which had been founded by Rennyo, establishing it as the new Ishiyama Honganji temple."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a key hub for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple, Shoko secured his power base by forging close relationships with various lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court."
"On the other hand, toward the end of the Shokujo era, some local Hongwanji Buddhist groups, particularly in the Hokuriku region, were beginning to deviate from the central temple's authority and pursue their own independent path."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kannon, the Hongan-ji Buddhist sect, which had de facto become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who aimed to unify the Kinai region by seizing control from religious forces and establishing his own dominion."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple, led by Kannon, entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and their supporters throughout the land resisting Oda forces, giving the Honganji Temple an advantage and causing significant trouble for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture), was destroyed by the Oda clan. In 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had regained Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed. Resistance in various areas was suppressed. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, lost their naval forces to the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River. Thus, the Honganji Temple faced repeated defeats outside its own territory."
"Despite retaining strong support from groups like the Saika, Hongan-ji gradually found itself increasingly isolated.  In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had secured an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to leave Ishiyama Hongan-ji.  This marked the end of Hongan-ji's power as a feudal lord."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, who advocated for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, fell out with him. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was chosen as his successor."
"From this point on, the Hongan-ji Temple began to split over the succession of the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site to establish the Higashi Hongan-ji Temple, separating it from the Hongan-ji Temple led by Kyo-nyo."
"At this time, many followers from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyo'nyo's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in a division of Honganji into east and west."
"Both the Ootani families, the eastern and western branches, descendants of Shinran, originally a son of the noble Hino Ariyori, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), had a tradition of their heads being adopted by powerful noble families. They also married into noble families for generations, further solidifying their connection to the nobility through their maternal lineages."
"Kyotanabe City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, near the border with Osaka and Nara Prefectures."
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It lies at the center of a triangular area encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, flowing north-south on its east side, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, with the West Japan Railway Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line traversing its center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are heavily characterized as bedroom towns."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), incorporated as a city from Tsuzuki District, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, which was originally named ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe Town,"" was elevated to city status (city enactment) as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the ""Kyoto"" prefix. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"However, the new city name was chosen from public submissions."

The statue of Ikkyū Zenji and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's representative stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyoutanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shindenbe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the central stations of Kyotanabe city center, while Matsuiyamaguchi Station acts as the central station of the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
"Furthermore, Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is served by ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line."
"JR Kyoutanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and was renamed to match the city's name around the same time as the city's establishment."
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While the town of Tanabe in Wakayama Prefecture has a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Main Line), the use of ""Kii,"" the former name of Wakayama Prefecture, in the station name is likely to avoid duplication with other stations in the same area of West Japan Railway Company."

Musashi Province was a former Japanese province.
"This corresponds to an area that includes present-day Saitama and Tokyo east of the Sumida River, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."

"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (year 13 of the Enryaku era) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was built across the districts of Katsura and Atago in Yamashiro Province. The city was laid out as a rectangular enclosure, measuring 4.5 kilometers east-west and 5.2 kilometers north-south."
"The Imperial Palace was to be established at the northernmost point of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing it into the Eastern Capital (Sakyo) and the Western Capital (Ukyo), with the eastern side being Sakyo and the western side being Ukyo."
The floor plan essentially follows Heijo-kyo and imitates the Sui and Tang dynasties' Chang'an.
There were no walls.
There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the concept of the Four Symbols of the Chinese practice of Feng Shui.
The Heian-kyo area was smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo-Oji, lies between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori, on Ichijo-dori."
The ninth avenue of the southern limit is the current Kyogoku-dori just south of JR Kyoto Station.
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Grand Road corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori.
The estimated location of the western limit of Nishikyo-oku Oji is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishikyo-ku Station from north to south.
"Kyōnai was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""jo,"" while a column of four towns aligned north-south is called a ""bo."""
The 16 towns belonging to the same district were each numbered.
"This led to each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jūyonchō""."
"Roads, even narrow lanes, were at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) wide, while main roads were over 8 zhang (about 24 meters) wide."
Existing roads in Kyoto are much narrower in most places.
"When it reached Suzaku Avenue, it was 28 zhang (about 84 meters) wide."
"Also, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishi Horikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that this move reflected an intention to establish a new capital under the reign of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of nobles and temples supporting the Emperor Tenmu line had gathered."
"However, only ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is thought to be influenced by a series of events that began with the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, leading to the dethronement of Prince Sawara, as well as the difficulties in completing the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) followed by the construction of the city (Kyō).
"The right-bank area of Kyoto, however, remained largely undeveloped until the 9th century as it corresponded to the wetlands shaped by the Katsura River (Yodo River system)."
"By the 10th century, the Ritsuryo system was largely defunct, leading to widespread devastation and even the conversion of land within the capital, forbidden for agricultural use, into farmland."
"Nobility residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Kōki is a historical record compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it records 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in 819, Emperor Saga ordered the compilation by Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi."
"The three others, excluding Prince Otsugu, died while the matter was incomplete. Subsequently, Emperor Junwa issued an edict, ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Prince Naoyoshi, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mineyuki, Sakanoe Imatsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue the task."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further edicts were issued, commanding Fujiwara Otsugu, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikaitori to carry out the task."
"Later, after adding Furutaka Niwa and Yamada Koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and Fujiwara no Otsugu alone was involved in the project throughout the three generations of emperors."
"Following the ***Nihon Shoki***, this chronicle covers the reigns of Heijo, Saga, and Junna emperors, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the collection was scattered in the early 15th century. It was rediscovered by Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of Hon'ami  Hokiichi, in 10-volume form at the Sanjo-nishi family (although some claim it was discovered in the form of a revised edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu), marking the first publication."
"The extant volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"The ""Nihon Kiryaku"" (an abridged version of the Six National Histories) and the ""Ruijū Kokushi"" (a categorized index of the Six National Histories) can be used to reconstruct the original text to some extent."
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes, there are ""Nihon Iti-shi"" and ""Nihon Goki Ibun,"" upon which the following publications by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko are based."
It is said that the content most reflects Fujiwara no Otsugu's views.
"The practice of appending short biographies (kōden) to the death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent set in the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the chronicle in this book does not simply fall into one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather contains many intriguing descriptions interspersed with unique criticism and impressions, making it exceptional among the six national histories for its unwavering critical spirit."
"It is also known that, among the Six National Histories, it included more waka poems than the preceding and succeeding historical works."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some sources suggest her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it remains unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara Motosuke, a prominent poet and one of the ""Five of the Pear Vase."""
"There is an old tradition that identifies his mother as ""Higaki no Ouna,"" appearing in the ""Gosenshu Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than an absurd and unfounded theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a leading poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"Among the siblings, there are Yasuragotono Tameari, Taizashōkan no Chisho, Kasuga-inari no Dajōhōshi Kaishu, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Seishōnagon's name is a court title, with ""Sei"" derived from the surname Kiyohara and ""Shōnagon"" taken from a relative's position."
"Her real name is unknown, though some suggest it was ""Nagiko"" (based on ""Makura no Soshi""), but this is unreliable."
"Considered one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she is known for her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Anthology of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the edition; the most widely circulated version contains 31 poems)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last Shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (Reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate."
"Her mother was Keishu-in, daughter of Konoe Norimichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He had been a Buddhist monk, but after Yoshiaki was assassinated by Matsu permanent long show and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"And, he was installed by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, ascended to Kyoto, and took office as the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming a siege network around him in alliance with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, they were eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending the Muromachi shogunate."
He later spent his remaining years with the aid of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was the heir, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji), taking the name Kakkei."
"Later, he was promoted to the rank of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple."
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Disturbance, the 13th shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsu permanent 秀 and the Three Good, and his brother, the abbot of Rokuon-in, Ashikaga Yoshikage, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsu permanent Hideyoshi and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that they did not kill him because they feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy. They feared this because Kakkei was the younger brother of the shogun and was promised the position of Kofukuji Temple Abbott in the future.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his Buddhist vows and took the name Yoshiaki."
"Books describing Yoshiaki mention that he was also referred to as ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and was attacked by night thieves, and was also called ""the impoverished shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jugoi no Ge (Lower Fifth Rank) and appointed as Sama no Kami."
"However, while there are doubts regarding the exact date of his appointment, the ""Kōyōki"" by Sanjō Saneuji states that in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), on the very day that the rival claimant to the shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiie, received his investiture, a messenger from Yoshiaki arrived at Saneuji's residence, who was the envoy for the investiture. The messenger asked Saneuji to intervene in securing Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi no ge, causing confusion. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed to this rank prior to this event."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshiteru first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide Brothers, Yoshiteru fled to Wakasa Province in August, where he sought asylum with his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitaka."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan, plagued by succession disputes and power struggles among senior officials, lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had the ""Kuradani Gosho"" of the Ashikaga Shogunate branch, Ashikaga Tsugutom, and had no intention of actively going to Kyoto with the newly secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the ascent to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The ceremony of capping was performed by Asakura Yoshikage (Note that there are no historical records indicating Yoshiaki officially came of age at this time, so it can be said that his coming of age was far too late given the circumstances of the time)."
"Eventually, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province to seek the patronage of Nobunaga Oda."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, backed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"Simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the positions of Counsellor and Lieutenant General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka, a distance of 42.8km, in a minimum of 28 minutes, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line along the right bank of the Yodo River (maximum speed: 130km/h)."
All sections are quadruple-tracked with separate quadruple-track lines (outer and inner lines).
"J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa are all accepted at all stations on the JR Kyoto Line."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"The line operates express trains, rapid trains, local trains (Kyohanshin Local Line) that run through to JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains running through this section surged significantly, as sleeping cars bound for Kyushu that originally departed from Shin-Osaka, limited express trains to the Kii Peninsula that started from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express trains to the San'in region, which were introduced after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all began making direct runs to Kyoto."
"The Haruka (train), which began operation simultaneously with the opening of Kansai International Airport, began running all its trains regularly to Kyoto the following year. The New Osaka – Kyoto line became a corridor of express trains, with up to four services per hour, including other trains like the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird."""
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"Downward express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"", which enter the Sanyo Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka, enter the freight line from the Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita signal station."
"Therefore, it takes a slightly longer time than express or rapid trains running on the outer lines in the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may arrive at Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line from Kyoto to Osaka is largely straight, with the outer tracks capable of 130 km/h operation except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also designed for 120 km/h speeds, but express trains never run on it (although there are exceptions for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also transfer trains like the ""Hamakaze"", ""Tanba"", and ""Hokkin-ki"" that run along this section due to their entry and departure from Mukomachi (Kyoto General Rolling Stock Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains, when running between Mukomachi and Osaka as a deadhead train, use the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-stopping train is to be stored in Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds in the down direction from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west, and then merges into the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The outbound route is the reverse of this.)"
"Therefore, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed when it is running in and out of the station."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Amagasaki and Kami-Gōri on the Sanyō Line, and Banshū-Akō on the Akō Line, through the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Ōmi-Shiotsu Station on the Hokuriku Line, and敦賀."
"From midday to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one Kyoto-bound train during the day running on the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly on the Biwako Line."
All four trains run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
8- or 12-car trains operated with JR West Series 223-1000 and Series 223-2000 trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, in the same prefecture, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478) extending approximately 100 kilometers."
"Running through Kyoto Prefecture from north to south, it strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, revitalizes the region, and serves as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a fragile high-grade road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture calls this road ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the middle, and the end point. The starting point opened under the name ""Keiz Bypass"" instead of ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, in common usage, Kyoto Danba Road is often referred to as the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"The mainline section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here; it will be extended as part of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-grade road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway."
"Note that the section between Kumiyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so a minimum speed limit applies and the passage of light vehicles, etc., is prohibited."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe-Kita Main Line Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe-Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open sometime between summer and fall of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  At the same time, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be under the management of the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. As a result, the currently toll-free section, Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, is also scheduled to become a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji Tollgate will be established."
The Ayamabe Angokuji IC currently does not have any toll booths.  This eliminates all toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe-Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line tollgate (Ayabe JCT) is built with a structure close to a temporary prefabricated building.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently underway by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with a planned opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The National Route 9 Oinozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a tolled road, while the National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section between Kutagiri IC and Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyodagawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) opened between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru-Ooe IC (two-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations responsible for roads were privatized, transferring ownership to the Japan Highway Public Corporation and management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a ■ background in the IC number column indicate roads that are in service.
"Also, areas with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is either not in use or not yet complete."
The name of the unopened section is tentative.
Simple and straightforward.
(Number) is the number of another line.
&lt;Number&gt; is the scheduled number.
"Enryakuji Temple is a temple located in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with its grounds encompassing the entirety of Mount Hiei, which stands at 848 meters above sea level."
"More often called Mount Hiei, or simply Eizan, than by its formal name, Enryaku-ji Temple."
It was also called Hokurei because it was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto).
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been, alongside Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple, a center of Heian Buddhism."
"It practiced the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land Buddhism, thus becoming a comprehensive university of Buddhism. During the Heian period, it gained the respect of the imperial family and nobility, becoming a powerful institution."
"Especially, esoteric Buddhist ceremonies and prayers gained support among the Heian aristocracy, with the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple of the Shingon sect (known as ""To-mitsu"") vying for dominance with the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, known as ""Dai-mitsu."""
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective name for the halls and pagodas of the three towers and sixteen valleys, including the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokawa, scattered throughout the precincts from the summit of Mount Hiei to its eastern foothills."
It began in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikanin.
"The temple name ""Enryakuji"", which took the era name of its founding, was only granted in 824, during the 14th year of the弘仁 era, after the death of Saicho."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks and is considered the cradle of Japanese Tendai Buddhism. It has been a place of training for many prominent Buddhist figures throughout history, including Ennin, Enchin, Ryonin (founder of Yuzu Nembutsu), Honen (founder of Jodo sect), Shinran (founder of Jodo Shinshu), Eisai (founder of Rinzai sect), Dogen (founder of Soto sect), and Nichiren (founder of Nichiren sect). Because it has played such a pivotal role in the development of Japanese Buddhism, Enryaku-ji is often called the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training such as ""12 Years of Mountain Retreat"" and ""One Thousand Days of Peak Pilgrimage"" are still practiced today, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times.  The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ooyamagui-no-kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuo no Obito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Jōkei era (780), he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 (the 4th year of the Enryaku era), he was ordained at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, becoming a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, driven by his own aspirations, chose not to seek a stable position at a major temple in Nara, but secluded himself on Mount Hiei near his hometown, devoting himself to ascetic practice and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra"", and ""Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple called Ichijō Shikan-in at the site of the present-day Daikōdō, consisting of a Yakushi-dō, a Monju-dō, and a sutra repository."
"This temple, also known as Hieizan-ji, was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"", after the era name, only after Saicho's death, in 824 AD (弘仁 14th year)."
"Emperor Kanmu, during his reign, became a devotee of Saicho. With the Emperor's patronage and support from the Wake clan, his close advisors, Enryaku-ji Temple on Mount Hiei gradually prospered as a national sanctuary to protect Kyoto from evil influences in the northeast."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a Gengakushō, a short-term overseas student."
He went to Tang Dynasty in 804 AD on a mission to Tang.
"Saicho went to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the Tendai Master Zhiyi's direct descendant, Dōsui, and Tendai teachings from Gyōman, the head of the monastery."
"Furthermore, he studied Esoteric Buddhism under Acharaya Junxiao at Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing) and Zen under Zen Master Hsuan-nien."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personified the moon and ruled over the night, alternative interpretations exist (discussed below)."
"It is also read as ""Tsukiyomi."""
"While the Kojiki records the tale of the slaying of the food god, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the text itself contains no definitive descriptions of its gender."
"Many lunar deities in other cultures are female, and there are also numerous warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food deity cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, supporting the theory that the deity could have been female."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, purified himself and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" offers contrasting accounts. It depicts the goddess as born from the left eye, not the right, and emerging from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand. The extent of her dominion also varies, encompassing the heavens, the sea, and other realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born in a complementary relationship with Amaterasu, the sun goddess, is an example of a recurring concept in comparative mythology, where similar ideas exist in various mythologies."
"For example, in the Chinese Pangu legend (in the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a myth that Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon after his death, and in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"Although Apollo was originally a separate deity from the sun god Helios, they were later identified as the same being."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and the moon, and appointed them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be seen as following the pattern of the sun and moon being born as opposites, a common motif in origin myths around the world."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi plays a relatively minor role in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, with few notable actions."
"There is only a brief mention of the origin of grains in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki""."
"There is also a theory that this balances things by placing a god who does nothing between the gods Amaterasu and Susanoo, who have contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in other pairs of deities, such as Amenominakanushi for Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri for Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [another deity] are the same god, as their domains and some of their stories overlap."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity, born from Izanagi's washing of his right eye, is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi is commanded to ""announce the land of Night's food,"" but his subsequent actions are never recorded."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's divine age simply states that Izanagi produced a moon god who shone with brilliance akin to the sun, dispatching him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, an alternative account in the First Book of Records states that Izanagi produced Amaterasu with a white bronze mirror in his left hand and Tsukiyomi with a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"While there are several stories describing Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, other accounts also tell of a command for her to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the ocean tide,"" which seems to stem from the belief that the moon controls the tides. This indicates a parallel existence of several stories about the birth of the three deities."
"In the fifth book of the chronicles, the eleventh entry tells how Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were jointly commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi, having been commanded by Amaterasu to meet with the Food-Bearing Deity (Ukemochi) in the heavens, descended to the Deity's presence."
"There is a myth that when the Food Deity offered food from her mouth as a feast, the Moon God Tsukuyomi was angered by the ""impurity"" and killed her with his sword."
"The body of the goddess of food gave birth to cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice, which became the origins of grains."
"Onmyōji was a government position in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system, belonging to the Yin-Yang Bureau of the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"A position assigned to practitioners of Yin-Yang Dao, based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, who perform divination, geomancy, and other techniques, later expanding beyond the original legal mandate to encompass divination, sorcery, and all forms of ritual."
"Since the medieval period, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and ritual ceremonies in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'youji"" without liaison."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which posits that all phenomena are constituted by a combination of these principles, originated in the Xia and Shang Dynasties of ancient China, reaching near-completion during the Zhou Dynasty.  Closely related concepts, including astronomy, calendar systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping, were directly transmitted from mainland China (Han and Sui Dynasties) or indirectly via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo, Baekje) to Japan during the Asuka period, between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 AD (Emperor Keitai 7th year), when scholars of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (Emperor Kinmei 15th year), when an I Ching scholar arrived."
"Initially, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602, when Kanroku, the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje, he lectured 34 carefully selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, on these subjects, significantly impacting the nation's governance."
"The first adoption of a calendar (Genka-reki) as the official calendar in Japan, coupled with the absorption of Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, led to the dispatch of the Sui envoy to the advanced civilization of Sui in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign). Moreover, the influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy is deeply reflected in the Seventeen-Article Constitution and the establishment of the Twelve Ranks of Nobility by Prince Shotoku."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send emissaries to Sui (later Tang), with students accompanying them, and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the Korean peninsula's west coast where they stopped over, in order to further acquire knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it was considered crucial to ""determine auspicious and inauspicious events, forecast the future, and gain guidance for all human affairs by understanding the movement and positions of the sun, moon, and stars through the principles of the Five Elements theory of mutual generation and mutual overcoming."" As a result, Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy became highly valued as a means to judge auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, and to obtain ethical guidelines."
"In 676 AD (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination who was so proficient in Yin-Yang and Five Elements theories that he personally used a *shi* [divination board] during the Jinshin War, established the Yin-yang Office and Japan's first astronomical observatory."
"The influence of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy deepened, with the term ""Onmyoji"" entering usage in 685 (Year 13 of Emperor Tenmu's reign). In 718, the Taihō Code formalized the establishment of the Onmyōryō, a bureaucratic office within the Ministry of Central Affairs, appointing astronomers, Yin-Yang scholars, Onmyoji, calendar experts, and clepsydra experts as permanent officials. This development solidified its role in official divination practices alongside the kami-worshiping Shingi-kan's divination using tortoise shells."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the continent were entrusted with these roles. Each doctor and Onmyoji was appointed from among the immigrants well-versed in various academic disciplines and skilled in reading classical Chinese, including those who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui (which replaced them as the dominant power on the continent), Goguryeo and Baekje, kingdoms that held sway over the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally Silla, the initial power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly, after the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent troops to aid Baekje, its close ally, and Silla unified the Korean peninsula, resulting in the fall of the Baekje dynasty, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees. Many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The initial technical skills of the Yin-Yang Bureau were purely divination, geomancy (what we now call ""feng shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and clepsydra. They were solely dedicated to astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements. They did not engage in religious ceremonies or sorcery like the Shinto priests or monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial Court and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and direction, which was vital during the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyōryō as a bureau of the Ritsuryō system and the duties of Onmyōji.
"The Onmyōryō has, as administrative officials, clerks who..."
"A position overseeing the Onmyōryō, supervising all matters of astronomy, calendar, weather, and omens. When anomalies occur, they are recorded and sealed without leakage to the outside and secretly reported to the court (astronomical secret report). The calendar doctor prepares the New Year's calendar annually by November 1st and submits it to the court (calendar report). Duties also include reporting the results of divination and geomancy as needed."
"Rank: Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade."
I assisted with the Yin-Yang Head duties.
"I conducted inspections within the dormitory and managed all administrative tasks, including document review."

Assisted in record-keeping for Yin-Yang Da-Shu.
As a skilled technician...
"An instructor who observes celestial phenomena and, in the event of anomalies, seals them off from outsiders, while also guiding 10 astronomy students in training."
"Since astronomy was considered the most difficult of the Yin-Yang and Five Elements doctrines in the Seven Ministries system, it was assigned a higher rank than other scholars."
An instructor who guides ten Yin Yang practitioners.
"He has been appointed to a high position, equivalent to that of an astronomy doctor, under the seventh rank."
