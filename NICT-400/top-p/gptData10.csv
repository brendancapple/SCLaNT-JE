"Along with the school corporations Waseda University and Keio University, it is the top school corporation."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience"" based on the spirit of Christianity."
Shinjirō Shima aimed to foster individuals who would utilize their conscience in their actions as the purpose of education he sought to establish.
"In order to prevent a bias towards knowledge-based education, it was desired to cultivate individuals who are filled with ""good conscience"" by promoting ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting carrying those thoughts exist in various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May all our strength be in our conscience"" are engraved on this monument."
"Furthermore, the educational philosophy for realizing this ""conscience"" education specifically includes the principles of ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism,"" aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
"It is a Protestant-based educational corporation founded on Christian principles, following the tradition of congregationalist (union) churches."
"However, their nature is different from what are commonly referred to as mission universities, as they do not have the main purpose of Christian evangelism (and do not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."

"Early on, he excelled in poetry, and his Chinese poems ""Spring Grass in Nagato"" composed at the age of 13, and ""Flowers Lodging on Spring Garments"" composed at the age of 15, became highly esteemed in the capital city of Kyoto, receiving praise."
"In the 17th year of Ōei era (1410), at the age of 17, I became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and changed my Buddhist name to Sōjun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's condition is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Oei (1415), he became a disciple of Kaso Sodon, a prominent monk at Daikakuji Temple in Kyoto."
"He was given the Buddhist name Ikkyu by Kaso after answering the koan of ""The Stick of Dongshan Thrice Struck""."
"""Having (samsara)"" refers to the world of delusion and defilement, while ""Not having (nirvana)"" refers to the world of enlightenment and the Buddha."

It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, wild songs, calligraphy, and madness."
"In the first year of Shochu (1428), Emperor Gokomatsu passed away without leaving a son, and Emperor Gohangarden was welcomed and ascended to the throne from the Fushimi-no-miya family."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Master Ikkyu from Tokai"""
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio claims that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Kameyama was supported by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era after the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the abbot of Daitokuji by imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado and dedicated himself to the revival of the temple, though he did not reside there."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo Imperial Visit of the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been referred to as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the formal Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of the city, but it was moved to the Sato-dairi due to damage caused by wars and other situations."
"The To-ji Eastern Inner Palace was one of the imperial residences in this village, where the emperors of the Jomyo-in lineage, later known as the Northern Court, resided through generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which came to be called the Southern Court, was located at Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not exactly the same as the original Tsuchimikado Higashidoin no Miya, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is also open to the public in the spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the imperial procession to Tokyo in the second year of the Meiji era (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sento Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north is Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both located on Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Villa, and Sento Imperial Palace are managed by the Imperial Household Agency, while the Kyoto Imperial Garden, a national park surrounding them, is managed by the Ministry of the Environment."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to Kyoto Imperial Palace, including Kyoto Imperial Palace Gardens, as ""Gosho."""
"However, unlike castles overseas, the walls surrounding the imperial palace are not very high. It is said that this difference is due to the sense of familiarity between commoners and rulers (such as the Emperor and other imperial family members) being different in the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This kind of event has not occurred in Japan, which is one of the bases for such analysis."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the JR Nijo Station in Kyoto."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences inside the Ritsuryo, called the Tsuchimikado Higashifukidera (つちみかどひがしのとういんどの), and was first used by Emperor Komyo of the Northern Court in the first year of Genko (1331)."
"The imperial palace located here was rebuilt a total of 8 times during the Edo period (6 times due to fires), and the existing building was rebuilt in the Ansei 2nd year of the late Edo period (1855) following the Heian style, known as the Ansei Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), when Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Tokyo Imperial Palace, visited Kyoto, he lamented the deteriorating state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo, and ordered for the palace to be preserved and its old appearance maintained."
"Major buildings at the palace include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's residence."
"The Ceremony of Enthronement has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, it was stipulated by the 1889 Imperial Household Law that the Ceremony of Enthronement and the Daijosai ceremony would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there are no specific provisions in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II for the location of the enthronement ceremony to be held in Kyoto. In 1990, during the enthronement of the current Emperor Heisei, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time in history at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the imperial enthronement ceremony, the Emperor takes his seat at the Takamikura throne, which is the official imperial throne symbolizing the Emperor's reign, located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokuirei Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the Shishin-den no Gi), the throne was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
Sumoku is a kirizuma-zukuri style gate with a hinoki bark roof and four pillars with a bay of one ken.
"The gate is only opened for special events such as the visit of the Emperor or dignitaries, or for public access."
"The left and right Tsuijibei walls are marked with five lines (horizontal lines), which also indicate the highest level of formality as a wall."
"Upon passing through this gate and the vermilion-lacquered tile-roofed Seiheimon gate, you will see the front of the Shikuniden hall."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
Below is a description of Japanese gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Heritage) that has been passed down to the Imperial Household Agency's music department.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance"", opposite of ""popular music""."
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu in Japan, it refers to music played by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, excluding Western music."
Many are inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the oldest form of traditional music still performed in large ensemble.
"However, as a traditional form of ensemble music, the continuity of the Heian period is questionable, as it had been interrupted for over 100 years until the Tokugawa shogunate reorganized descendants of court musicians (gakusha) after the Ōnin War."
"It is speculated that the music notation written in katakana for the shouga (chanting the melody in intoning style by adding rhythm to music notation) of the hichiriki faithfully reproduces the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century, such as pronouncing Ha as Fa, Fi, Fu, Fe, Fo, when singing."
"Things written in Chinese characters, like the notation of the Raku biwa, have many similarities with biwa notation found in Dunhuang, China, and many styles that were handed down from even older continents are also inherited."
"One of the most important historical documents is ""Taigensho"" written by Toyohara Tsuneaki (1450-1512), who was concerned about the dispersion of records such as Gagaku due to the Onin War."
"Tsugua Tsuguki, a member of the Komagaku family, compiled records about gagaku and bugaku centered around the sho, making it a valuable record of ancient gagaku."
"Ritual music originating from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century has been used as the basis."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the music currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music is said to have been transmitted from China, based on the music played at a Tang banquet called Yan Music."
"In terms of musical categories, there are a variety of international-sounding names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linyi music (music of Champa), as well as elements of ancient Japanese music that existed before the arrival of music from the continent."
"Before modern times, Shitenno-ji Tennoji Gakuso (Osaka City), the Imperial Court's Dainai Gakuso (Kyoto), and Kasuga Taisha Nanto Gakuso (Nara City) were considered the three main Gakuso locations that transmitted the oldest styles."
"These places of music were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Imperial Music Department, and the traditions of each place of music continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, there are also mutual influences between folk songs and statements, and a unique Japanese style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu."
Please refer to the lyrics of the S country style song and dance.
Things that have been transmitted from outside of Japan (some consider only this to be Gagaku).
"Left dance ・ Tang music ... Chinese, Tianzhu (India), and Linyi (South Vietnam) series"
"Right-hand dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) lineage."
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned style (Japanese music).
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period
The lyrics refer to the singing object.
There are cases where Gagaku and Bugaku are collectively referred to as ancient songs and dances.
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, my mother, Takano Shinkasa, is a descendant of the Baekje royal family, descended from King Munheung of Baekje."
"Queen Fujiwara no Otomuro bore the future Emperor Heijō (later known as Emperor Heijō) and Princess Jingo (later known as Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabuko bore the future Emperor Junna (later known as Emperor Junna)."
"After the father's ascension to the throne, the mother, Takano Shinkasa, belonged to the low-status immigrant clan, the Wa clan, and the crown prince was not desired. Initially, he aimed for promotion as a bureaucrat, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and middle counselor."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince, Prince Otomo, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and Prince Shioyaki was declared Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"The influence of various Nara Buddhism temples in Heijokyo became too great, prompting the relocation of the capital to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, but in 794 Heian-kyo was built again."
"To invade the Tohoku region again and subjugate the Ezo, a military force led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro was sent as the Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Akitomo of the Fujiwara Shike family for causing suffering to the peasants with such military and architectural projects."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai's return from Tang and their introduction of new movements in Japanese Buddhism also occurred during the reign of Emperor Kanmu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Hotta, as well as the dark side of Prince Hayoshi, who was made Crown Prince at the beginning of his reign only to be exiled and killed in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu, are also part of his legacy."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19th, 800 AD, Emperor Shunzong posthumously named Prince Sawara as Emperor Sudo, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the guardians of Saicho and Kukai, while existing Buddhism has been too involved in politics and exerted too much power, they have exerted pressure on various factions known as the ""Southern Capital Six Sects"" by confiscating their sealed lands."
"It is also said that the chaos in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident of Yaxie""."
"Passed away on March 17, 806 AD, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Japan root child imperial hallowing, given the posthumous name Yamato Neko Amatsuhitsugi Iyaderi no Mikoto."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was given a posthumous title in the Chinese style."
"Kashiwabara Tei, also known as the Emperor of the Heavenly Realm, Kamiwara Tianhuang."
"The tomb is considered to be the Kashiwabara tomb in Momoyamacho, Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he had insisted on being buried in Utono, but due to divination reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"In the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in one of the Three Palace Sanctuaries, the Imperial Spirits Sanctuary, within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, prior to the Emperor's birthday, Emperor Akihito made a statement during the customary press conference stating, ""I feel a connection with South Korea due to the fact that the mother of Emperor Kanmu is recorded in the Nihon Shoki as a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje, as we co-host the FIFA World Cup next year."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely covered by the South Korean media and became a hot topic."
"Some have gone so far as to make greatly exaggerated claims, such as, ""The Imperial Family has Korean ancestry,"" and ""the theory of the royal family's Baekje origins."""
"The Otani family (Otani-ke) is the family name of the descendants of Kakue, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hinokō no Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking noble of Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest of the main temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"When the custom of having a family name became required during the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo), which split off in 1602, took their titles as their surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of the memorial hall of Shinran, mentioned later, at the Otani grounds of the north gate of Chion-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Honnoji Temple was considered one of the powerful daimyo in the Sengoku period of Japan due to its involvement in the spread of the Ikko Ikki uprising. It was counted as one of the Sengoku daimyo, and it is common to refer to the chief priest's posthumous name (Jodo Shinshu) or given name with ""Honnoji"" attached, such as ""Honnoji Kennyo"" or ""Honnoji Koso"". However, this is just a convenience for naming, and the Honnoji Temple lineage did not make Honnoji Temple their family name or surname, nor did they have a family name of Honnoji."
"Kakushin-ni witnessed Shinran's passing in 1262 and in 1272 built a hall in Otani near his home in Higashiyama, Kyoto to enshrine his remains."
"Daishi Hall became the Daishi Mausoleum, gathering the reverence of Jodo Shinshu followers as Shinran's mausoleum. Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was designated as the caretaker of the mausoleum."
"However, the Otani mausoleum later became the center of disputes between Kakuei's son Kakunyo and his half-brother Isazen over the position of head priest due to the gathering of followers and donations from various regions. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious and established hereditary succession of the head priest position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Daishoninsect."
"Since then, the Honganji Temple inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo advanced the formation of the sect, and by the time of the 5th generation Jakkō during the Muromachi period, they expanded to the Hokuriku region. By the time of the 7th generation Zonnyo, the Honganji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious organization since Shinran's death, the formation of the organization was greatly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji was considered a sub-temple of Seirian-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also served as stewards for the Kujō family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Honen, who became the 8th head priest, the Hongan-ji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, the uprising of the Ikkō-ikki took place in 1488 against the background of the expansion of the teaching force during the time of Rennyo. As a result, the Honganji sect in Kaga drove out the guardian lord Tomokane, leading to the emergence of a situation known as the ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Hongan-ji sect, starting from humble farmers, strengthened its organizational power and expanded its activities throughout Japan, reaching the warrior class of samurai and local lords. However, in 1532, during the Tenbun Hokke no Ran, the Yamashina Hongan-ji temple suffered damage in the war, and the 10th head, Shonin, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo opened by Rennyo in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), becoming the Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Kamimachi Plateau.
"It was controlling Osaka, a key point in the river transportation at the mouth of the Yodogawa River."
"Establishing Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his headquarters, Shonin Shonin worked to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, since the end of the age of Shojo, some followers of the Higashi Honganji sect in regions like Hokuriku began to deviate from the control of Higashi Honganji and follow their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Honganji sect, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who was trying to establish unified control by taking away lordship power from religious forces."
"The so-called Ishiyama War, a conflict between the Honganji and Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, saw the Honganji temple stronghold at Ishiyama defended by Kyo-nyo and other temple followers coordinating resistance movements against the Oda clan in various regions. This alliance allowed the Honganji temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima Town, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizugawa, marking another defeat outside the Honganji Temple."
"Despite continuing to gather support from the Iga clan and others, Ishiyama Hongan-ji gradually became isolated within enemy territory. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The temple's authority as a feudal lord came to an end."
"At this time, Naramoto Kyonyo, who advocated for continuing to resist against the intentions of Kensho, disagreed with Kensho, and when Kensho passed away in 1593, his third son Junnyo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple began to walk the path of division over the position of the main gatekeeper, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Kyonyo a separate temple ground from Kyonyo's Honganji sect to establish the East Honganji."
"At this time, many disciples from the Jodo sect led by Junjo, who became Nishi Hongan-ji, moved to the guidance of Kyojo of Higashi Hongan-ji, causing Hongan-ji to split into East and West."
"Shinran, originally the son of the courtier Hino Arinori, and the heads of the Eastern and Western Hino families, who trace their lineage back to Hino Hironaga (father of Kakunyo), have a custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful courtiers, have continued to intermarry with courtiers for generations, and have advanced their status as courtiers through the maternal line."
Kyo Tanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo-tanabe City is located in the central part of the triangle zone of the three prefectures of Kyoto Prefecture's southern part, Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows along the east side of the city of Kizugawa, Kyoto Prefecture, while the city is sandwiched between the western Ikoma Mountain Range. The JR Kameoka Line and Kintetsu Kyoto Line run through the central part of the city."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as commuter towns."
"On April 1, 1997, the town of Tanabe in Shibetsu District became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was born as the 12th city, the 669th city in the country after a 20-year hiatus."
"In order to avoid overlapping with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe-cho in Tsuzuki District was renamed ""Kyotanabe City"" with the addition of ""Kyoto"" in front of it. On the same day, the city was also changed to ""Kyoto City Tanabe"" and the name of the city was changed to ""Kyoto Kyotanabe City."""
The new city name was selected through a general public application process.

"Kintetsu Shindenba Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi-Rose Town."
"In addition, regular trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line stop at Kintetsu Nippombashi Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe station was originally named Tanabe, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishi-Mukonoso Station and Higashi-Mukonoso Station.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the old country name of Wakayama Prefecture, ""Kii"", is included in the station name in Tanabe City in order to avoid duplication of station names within the same area of West Japan Railway Company."

"Musashi Province was one of the former provinces of Japan, a local administrative division under the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding the islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
The rank in the Engishiki is determined by the provincial governor and the class division of the provinces.
Heiankyo (Heian Capital) was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in an area spanning Katsuno district and Atago district in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the central part of present-day Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was a rectangular city with dimensions of 4.5 km east to west and 5.2 km north to south."
"Establish the Daigokuden at the northern center of the capital, and from there create the Suzakudai Road to divide the city into the districts of Sakyo on the left and Ukyo on the right (with the east side as Sakyo and the west side as Ukyo)."
"The layout plan is basically based on Heijo-kyo, following the example of Chang'an in Sui and Tang dynasties."
The castle walls did not exist.
There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods Correspondence concept derived from Feng Shui transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The main road of the northern boundary is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern boundary of Ninth Avenue is the slightly south of current JR Kyoto Station.
The eastern boundary of Tokyo Oshu is now equivalent to Teramachi Street.
The estimated area of ​​Saigoku's Saikyoji-dori Street in the west is a line connecting Nishikyogoku Station (Kyoto Prefecture) of West Japan Railway Company Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station north and south.
"In Kyoto, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring approximately 120 meters on each side by major and minor roads running in the east, west, south, and north."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two columns at the north edge) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same province was assigned a number.
"As a result, each town was called something like ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho""."
The width of the road was at least 4 jo (about 12m) in small roads and 8 jo (about 24m) in major roads.
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the Suzaku Avenue, the width was as much as 28 jo (about 84m)."
"In addition, parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishihorikawa Koji, rivers (Horikawa, Nishihorikawa) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to break away from the powerful nobles and temples that had supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu lineage, gathered in Yamato Province, and establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi lineage."
"However, just 10 years later in the year 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro province, where Heian-kyo was established."
"It is believed that the relocation of the capital was influenced by a series of incidents from the assassination of Fujiwara Tanezuke, which led to the ousting of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo."
It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo began with the building of the Imperial Palace (Daijokyu) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (urban area).
"However, due to being located in the wetlands formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), the area of Ukyo did not see much residential development even by the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system was largely rendered ineffective, there were cases where land was converted to agriculture, even though it was prohibited within the capital city."
The residential areas of the nobility were established in the left capital except for the northern part of the right capital near the imperial palace.
"Nihon Koki is a compilation of imperial edicts from the early Heian period, which serves as the third volume in the series of Six National Histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it records a period of 42 years from Enryaku 11 (792) to Tenchō 10 (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Kōnin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Three people, excluding Osugi, died before the completion, so Emperor Junnin later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Naoyuki-o, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minomori, Sakanoue Ietsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyo, further decrees were issued ordering Fujiwara no Motosugu, Minamoto Tsunemasa, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asakano Shitoru to carry out their tasks."
"Furthermore, later on, Furu Takaniwa and Yamada Furutsugu were added, and finally reported the completion on December 9, 841 (January 5, 842)."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who worked on the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Suketsuna."
"Following the Nihon Shoki, it describes the reigns of Heijou, Saga, and Junna Emperors during the reign of Emperor Kanmu."
"In the early 15th century, all 40 volumes were together, but later they were lost. It was then that one of Hani Hokiichi's disciples, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family and published it for the first time. (There is also an alternative theory of a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu.)"
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), making a total of 10 volumes, and the era of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"By quoting from the abridged version of the ""Nihonki Ryaku"" and the classification of the Six National Histories in the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" the main text can be partially restored."
"Collections of various excerpts can be found in ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"", incorporating which, Shueisha translated and annotated Japanese historical materials are published along with Kodansha's academic pocketbooks."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Michitsugu.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to articles on the deaths of emperors and court officials is in line with the style of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" and is also seen in later historical texts."
"However, the biography of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but contains many interesting descriptions with unique critiques and impressions, making it unique as maintaining a spirit of criticism among the six national histories."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical documents.
Sei Shonagon (circa 966? - circa 1025?) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"She was the daughter of Sei Shonagon, who was one of the five members of the Rihitsu group and a famous poet in his later years."
"There is an old legend that identifies my mother as ""Higaki no Ōna"" in the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" but this is nothing more than a fantastic and baseless theory."
"His great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become wives of Gagaku head Tamenari, Dazai Shoukan, Kaizaninjo Shikan and Fujiwara Michinori (brothers of Fujiwara Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a name of a court lady, with ""Sei"" taken from her family name of Seiwa Genji and ""Shonagon"" taken from a position in her family's government service."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""The Pillow Book"" excerpt), but it is not reliable to believe."
"She is counted as one of the thirty-six immortal poets of the Heian period, and a small collection of 42 poems called ""Sei Shonagon Collection"" is attributed to her."
"In the ""Koshikibi Wakashu,"" 14 poems were selected for the imperial anthology."
"Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, and the last shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588))."
"The father is the 12th shogun of the Ashikaga shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"My mother is the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi, Keiju-in."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"At first he was a Buddhist priest, but after Nobutaka was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other shogunate vassals."
He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino province and installed as the 15th shogun.
"Soon, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and together with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, they created a blockade against Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate was practically destroyed."
"After that, he received assistance from Motonari Mōri and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi and spent his remaining years."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who was the son-in-law of my brother, I entered the Buddhist priesthood at a young age and became an adopted son of my maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, under the name Kakukei at Hongan-ji Temple."
He later rose to the position of Gonso-sozu at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Sanjo Sanetsumu, and others, and my brother Ashikaga Sukemasa, who was the head of Deer Park, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and was imprisoned in Kohfukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared angering Kohfukuji Temple by killing Yoshiaki, who was the younger brother of the Shogun and had been promised the position of head priest in the future, so they kept him imprisoned)."
"However, with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yusai and Wada yoshimasa, he managed to escape and renounced his priesthood on February 17, 1566, and began using the name Yoshiaki."
"In books that describe Yoshiteru, it is written that he was also called the ""Warrior's Residence."""
"When he was expelled from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also called the ""Poor Governor."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Left Master of the Horse."
"There are doubts about the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Genkitsu's ""Genkitsu-kyo ki"", it is written that before the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshihide, a messenger of Yoshihide appeared at Genkitsu's residence on the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshie. who was recommended for promotion to Jusi-shimo, causing confusion.This makes it clear that he had been appointed before this incident."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshitoki first relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshitaka and Rokkaku Yoshiharu of Omi Province. However, because Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Trio, in August he fled to the son-in-law of his sister, Takeda Yoshifusa of Wakasa Province."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have enough power to send troops to Kyoto due to conflicts over succession and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to the Asakura Yoshiakira in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogun's authority."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already had the branch of the Ashikaga Shogun family, ""Kuruya Palace,"" with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, and did not have the intention to actively go up to Kyoto, accompanied by newly restored Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the journey to Kyoto did not materialize."
"Yoshikage Asakura is serving as the head of the Asakura clan (it is worth noting that there is no official historical document confirming that Yoshiaki had undergone his coming-of-age ceremony up to this point, which can be considered unusually late for the time)."
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, he moved to Mino Province to seek refuge with Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku era (1568), he was installed by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Jushii-no-jo (Junior Fourth Rank) and appointed as Sangi (Councillor) and Sakanoe no Chujo (Major General of the Left Division of the Inner Palace Guards)."
The JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto-sen) is the nickname for the stretch between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"Almost all along the way, it runs parallel to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also a Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kinki Nippon Railway, which is connected at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively, to avoid confusion, it is prefixed with ""JR"" in the nickname."
"The line color is blue (■), and since it is considered the company's main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is allocated as the line color."
"Running along the right bank of the Yodo River parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in the shortest time of 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8 km (with a maximum speed of 130 km/h)."
"It is a double-track line in both directions along the entire route (outer track, inner track)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-Surutto ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system has been introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that connect to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan Hanshin Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the Sanin region."
"Additionally, nearly half of the local trains operate up to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After JRization, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Haku to"" train to the San'in region which began operating with the opening of the Chizu Express line, all began running direct services to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section increased significantly."
"Haruka, which started operating at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running as regular trains to Kyoto within a year, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird."""
"As of March 15, 2008, all sleeper express trains departing from and arriving in Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued."
"Furthermore, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" entering the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka pass through the Ibaraki Station premises (3rd departure) onto the freight line, and enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita signal station."
"Therefore, the limited express and rapid express trains running on the outer track may take slightly longer travel time than the inner track, and there may be times when two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The track alignment is extremely good along almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line, and speeds of up to 130km/h are possible on the outer tracks, excluding some curved sections."
"The inside line is also compatible with 120km/h, but there are no express trains running on the inside (except for transfers and special trains)."
The limited express trains that run along this section are as follows.
"In addition, transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze Train,"" ""Tanba Train,"" and ""Hokukinki Train"" run on this section in relation to the entry and exit of trains into Mukainada Station (Kyoto Integrated Operations Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohamacho and Osaka for ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" passes through the Hokufu Freight Line."
"When storing a downbound train to the Kyoto Integrated Operation Center, proceed in the downbound direction from Osaka Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west side after passing Tsukamoto Station, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outside line) (opposite route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
"Shin-Kaisoku runs directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Line Ako, Kamigori, and Akashi Line Harima-Ako towards JR Kyoto Line via Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From daytime to night, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Kosei Line and the other three go straight to the Biwako Line in Kyoto."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12 cars using the JR West Japan 223 series electric train cars 1000 series and JR West Japan 223 series electric train cars 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Jukan Expressway is a high-standard trunk road with a total length of about 100km, starting from Kumiyama Town in Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"It runs north-south through the long Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region, and playing a role as a southern outer ring road in the vulnerable high-standard road network of the Kyoto urban area."
"The governor of Kyoto Prefecture referred to this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three locations, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, and the starting point side opened under the name of the Keiji Bypass rather than the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the term ""Kyoto Vertical Expressway"" is often used to refer specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road."
"The section from Kuyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed national highway, so the minimum speed applies, and passage such as small specials is not possible."
"Therefore, currently ETC installation work is being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are not allowed to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Public Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and you cannot drive only on the toll-free section."
"The Kyotamba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angukoji, scheduled to open in the summer to autumn of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Highway Corporation. At the same time, Ayabe Angukoji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Highway Corporation. Therefore, the currently free section between Ayabe Angukoji IC and Ayabe JCT is also expected to be converted to a toll road."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"As a result, the current Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, thereby eliminating toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line tollgate (Ayabe JCT) is built to be similar to a prefabricated temporary structure.
"""Construction of the Tanba IC to Keidanbawachi IC is currently underway by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an anticipated opening in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after opening is still unclear."""
"On February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinohama Kameoka Road (from Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (from Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatsukan IC ~ Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opens as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru Oe IC opens, connecting with the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (temporarily two lanes for opposing traffic)."
"On October 1, 2005: Through the privatization of the four road-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Organization, and management was transferred to NEXCO West Japan."
The part with a ■ as the background color in the IC number column indicates a section where the road is in service.
"In addition, areas where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that is not yet open is a tentative name.

"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei at an altitude of 848 meters as its precincts."
"Rather than by the name of Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei is more commonly referred to as Hiei-zan or just Hiei."
It was also known as Hokurei because it was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto).
"It is the head temple of the Tendai sect in Japan, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767 - 822)."
"The abbot (chief priest) is called the Tendai seat head, and oversees the branch temples."
"Since the establishment of Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and observation), and nenbutsu were also practiced, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great power and gained the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist prayers gained the support of the aristocracy during the Heian period, with the esoteric practices of Enryakuji being known as ""Daimitsu"" and competing with the esoteric practices of To-ji in the Shingon sect."
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the three towers and sixteen valleys of the temple towers that are scattered from the eastern foot of Mt. Hiei to the top of the mountain."
The year 788 marked the beginning of Saicho's construction of a small hermitage known as Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name taken from the era at its founding, Enryaku-ji, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824), after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks, including Ennin, Enchin, the founder of Yuzen Nenbutsu Ryonyu, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Hōnen, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism Shinran, the founder of Rinzai Zen Eisei, the founder of Soto Zen Dogen, and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism Nichiren. Many of the founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei when they were young, so it is also known as the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year mountain retreat"" and the ""1000-day pilgrimage to sacred peaks"" have been continued to the present day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization."
"Mt. Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it was believed to be a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. The Hiyei Taisha shrine in Sakamoto at the foot of the eastern side of the mountain enshrines Oyamatsuwashin, the landlord deity of Mt. Hiei."
"Saicho's lay name was Mitsunokurano (Mitsuno Obito Hirono), and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga District, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780 AD), I underwent ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Mii-dera temple in Ōmi province, taking the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20 in the year 785, he received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, officially becoming a monk."
"Due to certain thoughts, the young Eisai did not seek a stable position in the grand temples of Nara, but instead devoted himself to training and the study of scriptures on Mount Hiei near his hometown."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all Buddhist scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Commentaries on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple called Ichijo Shikanin in the current location of the Konponchudo, consisting of a Yakushido, Monjudo, and Kyozo."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hieizan Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was granted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Enryaku era (824)."
"Emperor Kammu of the Time relied on Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and the influential Wake clan, Mount Hiei Temple began to flourish as a dojo for national protection, guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802 AD), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a return student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of the Enryaku era (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a ship as part of a Japanese diplomatic mission."
"Enchin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana bodhisattva precepts with Great Master Chigi and Tendai teachings with Abbot Dōzui at Mount Hiei, a sacred site."
"In addition, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunyue Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"It is said that in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, he was created by Izanagi."
"It is believed that the moon is worshiped as a god who rules over the night, but there are also other theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"Due to the story of Hosuseri being cut and killed in the Nihon Shoki, he is generally considered a male god, but there is no description in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki that determines gender."
"In myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and in many other mythologies, goddesses with more aggressive personalities are commonly featured. Therefore, some scholars argue for the goddess theory, stating that there is no conclusive evidence that the story of Susanoo killing the Regalia of Japan must involve a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"According to the Kojiki, Izanagi was said to have been born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and performed purification, born from the other eye was Amaterasu, and born from his nose was Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki"", there is a story that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki"", and another story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, with her dominion not limited to the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born as a pair with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (The Book of History), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. In Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was not until later that they were identified with each other."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created in the sky ""two great lights,"" namely the sun and the moon, to govern day and night respectively, and separated light from darkness, telling of the creation of the sun and moon."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also thought to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in active participation."
"It is only slightly mentioned in the Nihon Shoki, Book Five, Section Eleven, that the origin of grains is being discussed."
There is a theory that balance is maintained by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of the gods Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in relationships such as between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and between Hoori (Yamasachihiko) and Hoderi (Umisachihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some argue that Susano-o is the same deity due to overlapping domains and episodes.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, it is said that when Izanagi washed his right eye, she was born and was called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susano."
"Tsukuyomi was ordered to inform about the ""land of night eating"", but after that, he did not play any active role."
There is also a theory that Izanami-no-kami is in the country of Yomi at night.
"In the fifth section of the divine age record in the Kojiki, it is briefly stated that ""a god of the moon that shines with radiance surpassing the light of the sun was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first book, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto is said to have given birth to Ohoyamatsumi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and to Tsukuyomi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories where it is instructed to rule the heavens alongside the sun goddess Amaterasu, and there is also a story where it is commanded to govern the eight hundred layers of the tide of the Canghai plain (this seems to have originated from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of three gods are parallel."
"In the fifth paragraph of the Record Book, it is said that Amaterasu Ōmikami and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was commanded to descend from the heavens to meet with the food-providing deity Uke Mochi at his place."
"There is a myth that, when the god of food, Hōsokami, served food from his mouth, Tsukiyomimi no mikoto was disgusted and angry, and ended up killing Hōsokami with a sword."
"From the dead body of the food god, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onmyoji) is one of the official positions that belonged to the Onmyo-ryo of the Nakatsukasahara under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the position of a technician (technician) who conducts divination, landforms, etc. based on the ideology of Yin and Yang and the five elements, and is placed as a technician. Later, it came to refer to the duties that go beyond the original ritsuryo regulations and oversee divination, sorcery, and all rituals."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who practice divination, witchcraft, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times, it is defined as a type of religious practitioner who conducts private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"Sometimes pronounced ""onyoji"" without gemination."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were transmitted directly from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, or by the arrival of the Gogyo Scholars from Baekje in 512 (Year 7 of Emperor Keitai) to the arrival of the Yi Scholars in 554 (Year 15 of Emperor Kimmu)."
"Although the initial influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD (10th year of Empress Suiko), Ganlè, who could be called a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats including Prince Shotoku, greatly influencing the country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka Calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar calculations, Japan began sending envoys to Sui, an advanced civilization, in 607 (15th year of Empress Suiko). Additionally, the influence of Yin Yang Five Elements philosophy became evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the system of twelve court ranks."
"Afterwards, the court also continued to send exchange students with envoys to the Sui Dynasty (later Tang Dynasty), and made efforts to invite numerous monks or scholars from the Korean peninsula's west coast or China's mainland or port cities, in order to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has become increasingly important in Japan to consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and to predict the future by judging good and bad luck based on the interactions of the five elements, in order to obtain guidance in various matters and determine one's actions. Therefore, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology has come to be emphasized as a strategy to judge fortunes and obtain guidelines for behavior."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was an expert in astrology and Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, even took up a divining wand to divine during the Jinshin War. In 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), he established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first astrological observatory."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the Tenmu era), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the philosophy of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements became even more popular. In 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs was formalized in the Yoro Ritsuryo, with the appointment of astronomical scholars, Onmyo scholars, Onmyoji, calendar scholars, and water-control engineers as permanent members. Alongside the Kekyu of the Jingikan, they were responsible for conducting official divination ceremonies."
"Those responsible for the technology brought from the continent are skilled in various fields, adept at deciphering Chinese texts. They are mostly immigrants from mainland China, who were under the domination of the former Han, Later Han, and then the Sui dynasty, as well as Goguryeo and Baekje on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. Occasionally, scholars from Silla, which initially held power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, are also appointed."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Year 2 of the reign of Emperor Tenji) where Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the downfall of the Baekje dynasty. During this period, a large number of scholars from Baekje came as refugees, and many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The initial skills of the Onmyoryo at the time of its establishment were purely divination, geomancy (similar to feng shui), astronomy, astrology, calendar creation, judgment of auspicious and inauspicious days, and timekeeping. They mainly predicted astronomical observations, calendar management, and the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis of the principles of yin and yang, without performing any religious ceremonies or rituals like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for maintenance work at the imperial court, as well as predicting the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as moving the capital."
The structure of the Onmyo-ryo as a system of government officials and the duties of the Onmyoji.
"In the yin-yang dormitory, there is an administrative official serving as an administrative official."
"Supervise the Onmyo Dormitory, oversee all aspects of astronomy, calendar, weather, and atmosphere, record and seal them without leaking to the outside in case of abnormal occurrences, report them secretly (astronomical secret report), present the new year calendar created by the calendar master by November 1 every year (calendar presentation), and report the results of divination and geomancy each time."

"I conducted general office management, including reviewing documents within the company."
I performed record-keeping tasks such as writing and reading official documents.
I assisted the Yin and Yang Department with record keeping duties.
"As an official with expertise,"
"An instructor who supervises ten astronomy students, seals any observations of astronomical anomalies to prevent leakage to outsiders."
"Among the various paths of Yin and Yang, astronomy was considered the most difficult, so it is set at a higher position than other doctors."
An instructor who guides 10 students in Yin and Yang theory.
"It is set at a high rank, just like an astronomer."
