The Doshisha Corporation (English: The Doshisha) is the educational corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha was founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima as a Christian Protestant (Congregational) school based on Christian principles, and is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational facilities bearing the name ""Doshisha"" from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 people are studying at Doshisha University."
"Currently, Doshisha School Corporation has obtained an <AA+> rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating out of 21 levels of ratings.
Waseda University and Keio University are among the top school corporations.
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience"" based on the Christian spirit."
Shinshiro Shimazaki aimed to cultivate individuals who could utilize their conscience in their actions as the purpose of education.
"It is desired to produce people who are ""filled with conscience"" by promoting ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel with education that does not lean towards knowledge education."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting expressing those thoughts can be found at various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May the spirit of righteousness fill the whole body and bring forth a strong will"" are engraved on this monument."
"Furthermore, in order to concretely realize this ""education of conscience,"" the educational principles of ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
It is a Protestant school corporation with roots in the Congregationalist tradition.
"However, it is different in nature from so-called mission-based universities and does not have the primary purpose of Christian evangelism (not using education itself as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation founded by one of the six great educators of the Meiji era in 1875, Shinshu Shimajima, which originated from Doshisha English School."

"Born in Kyoto, said to be a descendant of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara Nagamasa, ""Diary of Tohojo Nagamasa"" on August 1, 1494, it is written: ""It is said in secret that Ikkyu Sojun is the illegitimate child of Emperor Gohan of Gosho-in."""
There is no one in the world who knows it.
"According to later historical records, his childhood name was Senkikumaru."
"He was later called Zhou Jian, and went by the aliases of Kuang Yunzi, Xialu, and Mukei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shu Jun, also written as Shu Jun."
Ikkyu is a Buddhist monk's title.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist name"" section for information on posthumous Buddhist names and Buddhist names."
"At the age of 6, he entered the Ankokuzan Hōkō-ji in Kyoto and received the precepts, and was named Shūken."
"From an early age, he excelled in poetry. His Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass,"" written at the age of 13, and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Flowers,"" written at the age of 15, became well-known and praised in the capital city of Luoyang."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Sui and changed his name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's behavior is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of the Ōei era (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a high priest of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto."
"He received the title of Ikkyu from Kaso for his response to the koan ""The stick of Dongshan's three pounds: if you have it, give it to me; if you don't have it, I'll take it away."" He replied, ""Going from being to non-being, take a rest. If it rains, let it rain; if the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Arroji (world of defilements)"" refers to the world of delusion (afflictions), while ""muroji (world of enlightenment)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in the 27th year of Oei (1420), upon hearing the cawing of a crow, I suddenly had a great realization."
"The old man tried to give Ikkyu a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, mad songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Shōkō passed away without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and ascended to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the East Sea""."
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono was approved by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of Bunmei after the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the head priest of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, the 47th head priest. He did not reside in the temple, but worked tirelessly for its revival."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho) is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo visit of the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and it was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it was also known as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to the Rikyu Palace due to damage caused by wars and other factors."
"The Togu Palace of the Tsuchimikado East Doin was one of the palaces in this village, where the imperial family of the Jomyo-in line, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be called the Southern Court, was located in Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the original Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in, but rather an expansion based on the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Imperial Court moved to Tokyo in the second year of the Meiji era (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is state-owned property classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north on Imadegawa Street are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both campuses are located on Imadegawa Street)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Sento Imperial Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace as ""Gosho,"" including the Kyoto Imperial Garden."
"There is a theory that the relatively low walls surrounding the Imperial Palace, unlike the high walls of castles in other countries, reflect the difference in the sense of closeness between the common people and rulers (such as the Emperor and the imperial family) in the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This is one of the reasons why such incidents have not occurred in Japan."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the Nijo Station of West Japan Railway, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the retired Emperor, called the Tsuchimikado Higashifushimi-no-miya, and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of the Genko era (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was here was rebuilt eight times only during the Edo period (six of which were rebuilt due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855) in the Heian style, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating condition of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"Main buildings include the Shishin-den, Seiryo-den, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den Hall in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the former Imperial Household Law established in 1889 (Meiji 22), it was stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai ceremony should be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there is no specific provision in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II that the enthronement ceremony must be held in Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, for the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing the enthronement, which is located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokuirei-Seiden-no-Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishin-den-no-Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
"Sugi, kirizuma-zukuri, hiwada-buki, hashira-aida ikken no shikyakumon de aru."
"The gate is only opened for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, important guests, or public viewing."
"On the left and right walls of the Tsukiji fence, there are five lines (horizontal lines) running through, which also indicate the highest level of formality as a fence."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-lacquered tiled Shouming Gate, you will see the front of the Purple Forbidden City."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on Japanese gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency's Music Department (Important Intangible Cultural Property).
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, excluding Western music."
Many of them have been inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the oldest form of traditional music in the world that is still performed in large ensemble format today.
"However, as a form of ensemble music in its original form, it had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of court musicians (gakka) and reorganized it, so it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been inherited."
"It is speculated that when singing the notation written in katakana of the hichiriki as a shouga (chanting the melody silently to read the music), the pronunciation of the ha-row is pronounced as fa, fi, fu, fe, fo, preserving the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century. Overall, it is believed to be faithfully reproduced."
"Things written in kanji, like the notation for the raku biwa, share many similarities with the biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and further inherit many styles that were passed down from even older continents."
"One of the most important historical documents is the ""Taigen Shou"" written by Toyohara Noriaki (1450-1512), who was concerned about the dispersal of records such as Gagaku due to the Onin War."
"Tsuneaki, the head of the Shakuhachi family, compiled records about Gagaku and Bugaku centered around the shakuhachi. It is a valuable record about ancient Gagaku."
"The music for rituals that originated from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music played at a banquet called Yan music in the Tang dynasty."
"In terms of music categories, names with international colors such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linyi music (music of Champa) are transmitted, and elements of ancient Japanese music from before the arrival of continental music are also included."
"Before modern times, the oldest styles were transmitted through the Sanpogakusho, which included Tennoji Gakusho in Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), Dainai Gakusho in the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and Nanto Gakusho in Kasuga Grand Shrine (Nara)."
"These music schools were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each music school continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences can be seen between folk songs and statements, leading to the creation of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency's Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of the S-style song and dance.
Things that have been transmitted from outside Japan (some consider only these to be gagaku).
"Left dance, Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Lin Yi (Southern Vietnam) styles."
"Right-hand dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origin."
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned style (Japanese music).
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period
The lyrics refer to a song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances and recitations are collectively referred to as ancient songs and dances.
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shin no Kashira, the mother, is said to be a descendant of the Baekje royal family, with King Munju of Baekje as her ancestor."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince Yasukado (later Emperor Heijō), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, King Hakoku, ascended to the throne, Prince Shotoku was not desired to be the crown prince because his mother, Empress Kogyoku, came from the low-ranking immigrant clan of the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat, serving as a chamberlain, head of the university, and minister of the center."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and the younger half-brother was proclaimed Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"The influence of the various Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo had grown too large, so the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built again."
"To invade the Tohoku region again and bring the Emishi under control, a military force was sent with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the commander-in-chief."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing suffering to the peasants with such military and construction projects."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new developments to Japanese Buddhism under the rule of Emperor Kanmu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Tachibana, as well as the dark aspect of the beginning of his reign, where his younger brother Prince Sawara, who was the Crown Prince, was exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara no Taneie and died in confinement."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Saga posthumously honored Prince Sawara as Emperor Sudo, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, on the other hand, existing Buddhism has been too involved in politics and has exerted pressure on the so-called ""Nanto Rokushu"" factions, such as confiscating their land."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident at Yaxie""."
"He passed away on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Emperor Jimmu, who was posthumously known as Yamato Takeru no Mikoto, was enthroned as the first Emperor of Japan."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given the Chinese-style posthumous title."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tenkoku Oshihara Miya Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he was insistent on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"In the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at Heian Shrine."
All emperors are enshrined in one of the three Imperial Mausoleums at the Imperial Palace.
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, which has become a tradition, Akihito made a statement during a press conference regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was widely reported in the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"Some media outlets have made significant leaps in logic, such as claiming that the Imperial Family has Korean ancestry and promoting the theory of the Imperial Family's Baekje origins."
"The Otani family (Otanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hino Hiroyuki was a lower-ranking noble in Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest of Hongan-ji, the largest sect of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo), which split in 1602, took on surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the fact that the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, was established in the Otani area north of the main gate of Chion-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Hongan-ji was considered one of the daimyo (feudal lords) during the Sengoku period in Japan, as it had power comparable to other daimyo due to the spread of the Ikko Ikki movement. It is common to refer to the head priest with the temple's name, such as ""Hongan-ji Kennyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosa,"" but this is simply for convenience and does not mean that the head priest's family lineage made Hongan-ji their surname. There was no family or clan known as the Hongan-ji clan."
"Kakushin-ni watched over Shinran's deathbed in 1262, and in 1272, she built a hall to enshrine his remains in Otani near her home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Daibutsu-do became a place of worship for Jodo Shinshu followers as the mausoleum of Shinran, attracting their reverence. Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was appointed as the caretaker of the temple in his absence."
"However, the Otani mausoleum later became the subject of dispute between Kakuei's son Kakunyo and his half-brother Yoshizen over the position of head priest, as it attracted pilgrims and donations from various provinces. Kakunyo eventually emerged victorious and established the hereditary succession of the head priest position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Honganji Temple and advanced the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation Jakkunyo in the Muromachi period, the Honganji sect had expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation Sonnyo, the Honganji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious organization since the death of Shinran, the formation of the organization was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a sub-temple of Seiren-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's birth family), also acted as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Tomogashi family by the Honganji sect in Kaga, resulting in the emergence of a situation known as the ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from humble farmers, utilized its organizational strength to expand its activities throughout Japan, reaching the warrior class such as samurais and local lords. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532, and the 10th head, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), renaming it Ishiyama Honganji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located on the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodogawa River was dominated by Osaka.
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Jisho era, in regions such as Hokuriku, some members of the local Honganji sect were beginning to deviate from the control of Honganji and follow their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji sect, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away feudal lord power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan, which lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple, fortified in Ishiyama, collaborating with followers across various regions to resist the Oda clan. This alliance allowed the Honganji Temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for Honganji Temple outside its walls."
"While maintaining its strength by gathering support from the Iga clan and others, Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The power of Hongan-ji as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, the eldest son Kyonyo and Kenyo, who advocated continuing to resist against Kenyo's intentions, had a falling out. When Kenyo passed away in 1593, his third son Junyo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Hongan-ji began to walk the path of division over the position of the head priest, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted a separate temple ground to Kyonyo's Hongan-ji sect, splitting it into the East Hongan-ji."
"At this time, many followers from the Jodo sect led by Junjo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, moved to the guidance of Kyonyo, the head of Higashi Honganji, and Honganji split into east and west."
"Shinran, originally the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the head of the Eastern and Western Tani families, who descended from Hino Hirotane (the father of Kakunyo), had a tradition of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles for generations. They also continued to intermarry with court nobles for generations, leading to the advancement of their noble status through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo-tanabe City is located in the central part of the triangular area of the three prefectures, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows north-south along the eastern side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while it is sandwiched between the Ikoma Mountain Range on the western side, with the JR West Kameoka Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line passing through the central part."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, the town of Tanabe in Tsukigata District became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was born as the 12th city in 20 years, and the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District was renamed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the prefix ""Kyoto"" to become ""Kyotanabe City"", and the city's name change was implemented on the same day."
The new city name was selected through a general public offering.

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintoku Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyamate Station."
"Kintetsu Nintoku Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, regular subway trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line also stop at Kintetsu Nintoku Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation."
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikatabiranishi Station and Higashikatabiranishi Station.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the use of the old province name of Wakayama, ""Kii,"" in the name of the station in Tanabe City is to avoid duplication of station names within the same West Japan Railway Company's jurisdiction."

Musashi Province (Musashi no kuni) was one of the provinces of Japan that was once a local administrative division.
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in the current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is provincial governor, provincial class division, distant provinces."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built in the area that now corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanning the Katsura District and the Atago District in Yamashiro Province. It was a capital city that was divided into a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Establishing the Imperial Palace at the northern center of the capital, and from there, placing the Suzaku Avenue through the center of the city, with the left side being the Left Capital and the right side being the Right Capital (the east side is the Left Capital, and the west side is the Right Capital)."
"The layout plan is basically based on Heijokyo, following the example of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"However, there were no city walls."
"There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to Feng Shui, which was transmitted from China."
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost main road is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern limit of Kujo Oji is Kujo Street slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Gokumai Road corresponds to the current Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Saigen on Nishikyogoku Oji is a line connecting the JR West Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station in a north-south direction.
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 jo (approximately 120m) on each side, with major and minor roads running in the east, west, south, and north directions."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district had a number assigned to them.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
"The width of the road was at least 4 jo (about 12m) even in small roads, and 8 jo (about 24m) or more in major roads."
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the Suzaku Avenue, the width was 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, there were rivers (Horikawa, Nishihorikawa) flowing parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built the city of Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu's lineage in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi's lineage."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents that began with the assassination of Fujiwara Tane-tsugu in Nagaoka-kyo and led to the removal of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo began with the building of the Imperial Palace (Dairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Shigai).
"However, due to the fact that the area of Ukyo is a wetland formed by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), urbanization did not progress even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become obsolete, there were cases of land being converted to agricultural use, which was originally prohibited within the capital."
"The residential area for the nobility was established in the left capital, excluding the northern part of the right capital near the Daitokuji."
"The Nihon Koki is an official history book compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the six national histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of the Jōwa era (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tenchō era (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara no Tsugutsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Three people, excluding Otsugi, died without being resolved, so Emperor Junwa later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Naoyuki O, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakagami Imatsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyo, further edicts were issued to Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsunemoto, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asakano Shitoru."
"Furthermore, after adding Furutakaniwa and Yamada Furuetsugu, the completion was finally reported on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841) in the 7th year of the Jōwa era."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only person who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Suketsugu."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text records the reigns of Emperor Heijou, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna during the reign of Emperor Kanmu."
"In the early 15th century, there were 40 volumes of the text, but they were later scattered. It was not until the disciple of Hani Hoemiichi, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family (there is also a theory that it was edited by Yanagihara Norimitsu) that it was first published."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijou), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, with the reign of Emperor Junna completely missing."
"It is possible to partially reconstruct the text from the excerpt version of the six national histories such as ""Nihonki Ryaku"" and the classification of the six national histories in ""Ruiju Kokushi""."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"" which collect excerpts from various places, based on which, the following Shueisha translated and annotated Japanese historical materials and the Kodansha Academic Bunko have been published."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Noritoshi.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Nihon Shoki,"" and is the same as other subsequent historical books."
"However, the obituary of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, making it unique in the Six National Histories for maintaining a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical records.
Sei Shonagon (around the third year of the Kocho era (966?) - around the second year of the Manju era (1025?)) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The daughter of the famous poet Sei Shonagon, who was one of the ""Five Men of the Pear Jar"" and lived in the late years of the Heian period (908-990)."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a wild and baseless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become the wives of Gagaku leader Narinari, Dazai Shokan, Kaisyu of Hanayama-in, and Fujiwara Norinou (the siblings of Fujiwara Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a pseudonym, with ""Sei"" taken from her family name Seiwa and ""Shonagon"" from a court title held by her relatives."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Shou""), but it is not reliable to believe."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection ""Kiyoshonagonshu"" consists of 42 poems (though some versions have 31 poems)."
"In the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" 14 poems were selected for inclusion in the imperial anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father is Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"The mother is Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a half-brother."
"At first, he was a monk, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and went up to Kyoto, where he became the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and, in conjunction with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, built a coalition to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate was effectively destroyed."
"After that, he spent his remaining years with the support of Motonari Mōri and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was a legitimate child of my older brother, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, I became the adopted child of my maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofukuji Ichijo-in), taking the name Kakukei."
He later advanced to the position of Gonsoshosu at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiteru, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Sanjo Saneki, and my younger brother, Ashikaga Shusonin, who was the head of the Kano-in, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of head priest of Kofukuji Temple in the future)."
"However, with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Koremasa, he managed to escape and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In books that mention Yoshiaki, it is noted that he was also referred to by other names such as the Warrior's Residence."
"When he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also known as the ""Poor Governor""."
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Sadenji (Left Horse Head)."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Genkitsu's ""Genkitsu Kyo-ki"", it is clear that he had already received the appointment before the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshihide, who was a rival to Yoshiaki, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), when the envoy of the appointment appeared at Genkitsu's residence to request mediation for promotion to Jushi-shita on behalf of Yoshiaki."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki initially relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshikata and Rokkaku Yoshiharu, in Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Sanjo Sanemitsu, so in August he fled to the son-in-law of his sister, Takeda Yoshitsugu in Wakasa Province."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have enough power to go up to Kyoto due to struggles for succession and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to the Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already held the ""Kuragari Gosho"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, along with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, and did not have the intention of actively going up to the capital with the newly secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the journey to the capital did not materialize."
"The role of Kanmuriyaku is being served by Asakura Yoshikage (Note that there is no official historical document that confirms Yoshiteru had undergone the coming-of-age ceremony up to this point, making it a very late coming-of-age ceremony for the time)."
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, he moved to Mino Province to seek the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Jushi-i-no-jo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and appointed as Sangi (Councilor) and Left Guard Middle Captain."
The JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto-sen) is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion because the Keihan Kyoto Line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and because it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
"It is a double-track line in both directions for the entire section (outer track, inner track)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-SURF ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system has been introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that run on the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan Hanshin Kanko Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Furthermore, nearly half of the local trains will stop at Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR conversion, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train to the San'in region which started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express, began to run directly to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating simultaneously with the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running as regular trains to Kyoto one year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"In addition, the overnight express trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were completely discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" from Shin-Osaka that pass through the Osaka Loop Line and enter the Hanwa Line, enter the freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the limited express and new rapid trains running on the outer track may take slightly longer than the same section, and there may be times when two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka at the same time depending on the time of day."
"The track alignment is extremely good along almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line, allowing speeds of up to 130km/h on the outer tracks except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling speeds up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for transfer or special trains)."
The limited express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, there are transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train),"" ""Tanba (train),"" and ""Hokukinki (train)"" running on this section in relation to the storage and retrieval at Mukaijima-cho (Kyoto General Driving Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohata-cho, Osaka and Osaka on the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" lines will pass through the Hokkoh Freight Line."
"When storing a train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto Integrated Operations Center, proceed in the direction of Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the north freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route is taken when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
The Shin-Kaisoku operates direct services from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Ako Line from Harima-Ako direction to JR Kyoto Line via Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station to Tsuruga.
"From daytime to nighttime, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Kosei Line, while the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12 cars using JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 1000 series and JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100km, starting from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"The long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture runs through, strengthening the collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region, and serving as a southern outer ring road for the vulnerable high-standard road network in the Kyoto metropolitan area."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, with the starting point side operating under the name of the Keiji Bypass instead of the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the term ""Kyoto Vertical Highway"" is often used to refer specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"In addition, the section between Kuyamayodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed expressway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage of small vehicles is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5 meters are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the toll-free section."
"The Kyoto Tanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open around the summer to autumn of 2008, is planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current toll-free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also planned to be tolled."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"As a result, the current Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, and therefore there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built to be close to a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanba Wachi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinokozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatukake IC to Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC begins operation as a toll road for general use."
"March 8, 1998: Connection between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru Oe IC opened, connecting Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (provisional two lanes for opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: Privatization of four road-related public corporations transferred ownership to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections with a ■ background color in the IC number field indicate that the road is in service.
"In addition, the part where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicates that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that has not been opened is provisional.
MUJI has no BS.
The number is for another route.
<Number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire Mount Hiei with an elevation of 848 meters."
"Rather than being called by the name of Enryaku-ji, it is often referred to as Mount Hiei, or simply Hiei."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the founding of Kukai, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and insight), and chanting of the Buddha's name were also practiced, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great power and received the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the ritual prayers performed by esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple competed for supremacy against the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple in the Shingon sect (To-mitsu), which was known as ""Tai-mitsu""."
"""Enryaku-ji"" refers to the total of the three towers and sixteen valleys, such as the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokogawa, scattered in the precincts from the mountaintop of Mt. Hiei to the eastern foot."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, marking the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" taken from the era name at its founding, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks, including Ennin and Enchin who laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryōnin the founder of the Yūzū Nembutsu school, Hōnen the founder of Jōdo-shū, Shinran the founder of Jōdo Shinshū, Eihei Dōgen the founder of Sōtō Zen, Eisai the founder of Rinzai Zen, and Nichiren the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained at Mount Hiei in their youth, earning it the nickname ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and the ""1000-day Pilgrimage to Peaks"" have been continued to the present day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyamazumi no Kami, the landlord deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga District, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the 4th year of Enryaku (785), I received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a formal monk."
"Young Eisai, for various reasons, did not seek a stable position at a major temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei near his hometown to devote himself to training and studying scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the many scriptures, and he studied the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi (""Commentary on the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""Great Concentration and Insight"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple called Ichijo Shikan-in at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, consisting of Yakushi-do, Monju-do, and Kyozo."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"During the reign of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho received the Emperor's support and the assistance of the influential Waki clan, allowing Mount Hiei to flourish as a dojo for national protection, guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a ship as part of a diplomatic mission."
Enchin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of Doji and Ennin at the sacred site of Mount Hiei.
"In addition, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is commonly believed that the moon is deified and is considered a god who rules over the night, but there are also alternative theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Nihon Shoki about the god Yasakatsumi being killed, so although generally considered a male god, there is no description in the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki that determines the gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and there are also many goddesses with aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the goddess theory, stating that the story of the killing of Hosokami by a male god cannot be definitively proven."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and performed purification, and Amaterasu, born from his other eye, and Susanoo, born from his nose, together form the three noble children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there is a story that she was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and another story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, and her dominion is not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in opposition to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Chronicles of the Five Phases""), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also depicted as twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from the sun god Helios, and it was not until later that the two were identified with each other."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to govern the day and night respectively, and to separate light from darkness. This is the creation of the sun and moon as described in the Bible."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in activity."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the Nihon Shoki, Book Five, Section Eleven, that the origin of grains is discussed."
There is a theory that balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"A similar structure can also be seen in the relationship between Amaterasu and Takamimusubi, as well as between Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Umisachi-hiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
Some people argue for the theory of the same god because Susano'o's dominion and episodes partially overlap.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, it is said that when Izanagi washed his right eye, Amaterasu and Susanoo were born along with him, and they are called the ""Three Precious Children."""
"Tsukuyomi is ordered to ""inform the night food country,"" but there is no further activity after this."
There is also a theory that it is the country of Yomimi where the god Izanami is.
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, the Age of the Gods, it is briefly stated that ""a god of the moon, shining brightly after the sun, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first book, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto gave birth to Oho-namuchi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and to Tsukiyomi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu-Omikami in the domain of dominion, while there is also a story of being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tides of the vast sea plain (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of three gods are parallel."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu-Omikami and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was commanded to descend from the heavens to meet with the god of food, Ukemochi, sent by Amaterasu."
"In response, the god of food and agriculture spat out rice as an offering, but Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was disgusted and angry, so he killed the god of food and agriculture with a sword."
"From the corpse of the food god, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions belonging to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasasho under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the position of a skilled official (technician) who performs divination, geomancy, and other tasks based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and is later responsible for overseeing divination, sorcery, and all aspects of rituals beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who practice divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It may also be pronounced as ""onyoji"" without linking sounds."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the arrival of the Five Classics scholars from Baekje in 512 (7th year of Emperor Keitai) or the arrival of the Yi scholar in 554 (15th year of Emperor Kinmei)."
"Initially, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602 AD (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), Kanro, who became a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Prince Shotoku, which began to have a significant impact on our country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, an envoy was sent to Sui, an advanced civilization, in 607 (Emperor Suiko's 15th year). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"Afterwards, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the missions to Sui (later Tang) dynasty, and also invited numerous monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula or mainland China to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has come to be considered important in Japan to predict the future by considering the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and judging good and bad luck based on the principles of the Five Elements generating and overcoming each other, in order to obtain guidance for various matters and norms for action. As a strategy to judge good and bad luck and obtain guidelines for action, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy has come to be emphasized."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, took a divination rod during the Jinshin War and established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the Tenmu Emperor), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin-Yang Five Elements ideology became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasa-sho was officially recognized. It was stipulated that the positions of astronomer, onmyoji, calendar expert, meteorologist, and timekeeper expert would be permanently assigned to this bureau, alongside the diviners of the Jingikan, to officially oversee ritual divination."
"Those responsible for the technology brought from the continent are often scholars and onmyoji who are well-versed in various fields and skilled in reading Chinese texts. They are typically immigrants from mainland China, who have held power in the past such as the Former Han, Later Han, Sui dynasties, as well as Goguryeo and Baekje on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholars who originally came from Silla on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of Tenji), where Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the downfall of the Baekje dynasty. During this period, many scholars from Baekje immigrated as refugees, and many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo at the time of its establishment were purely divination, geomancy (similar to what is now called ""feng shui""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the management of the calendar. Therefore, they mainly predicted astronomical observations, managed the calendar, and judged the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of Yin and Yang, without performing any religious rituals or sorcery like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court and in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyo-ryo as a system of government officials and the duties of Onmyoji.
"In the Onmyo Agency, there is an administrative official who serves as a government official."
"Supervise the Yin-Yang Bureau, oversee all aspects of astronomy, calendar, weather, and atmosphere, record and seal any abnormalities without leaking to the outside, report secretly (astronomical secret report), present the new year's calendar created by the calendar master by November 1 each year (calendar report), and report the results of divination and geomancy as needed."
"The official rank is Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade."
I performed assistant duties for the Yin-Yang Master.
"I conducted the overall management of office work, such as reviewing documents within the dormitory."
I conducted record-keeping tasks such as writing and reading official documents.
I assisted the head of the Yin-Yang Department in carrying out record-keeping tasks.
"As an official with expertise,"
"An instructor who guides 10 astronomy students who are trainees, seals any observations of astronomical phenomena and ensures that they do not leak to the outside."
"Among the various paths of Yin and Yang, astronomy was considered the most difficult, so it was set at a higher rank than other doctors."
An instructor who leads a group of 10 students in Yin Yang Sheng.
"It is set at a high rank, just like an astronomer."
