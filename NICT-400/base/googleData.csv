"The Doshisha Educational Corporation (written in English as The Doshisha) is an educational corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts belong."
"Doshisha University was founded in 1875 by Yoshida Jo. It is a Christian school based on Protestantism (Congregationalism), and is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational institutions bearing the name ""Doshisha"" from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 students are studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University Corporation has received an &lt;AA+&gt; rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
"&lt;AA+&gt; is the second highest rating out of 21 levels."
"It is the top educational institution along with Waseda University and Keio University."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience"" based on Christian principles."
"Niijima Jo set the purpose of founding the school as nurturing ""people who use their conscience to their advantage."""
"In order to avoid placing too much emphasis on intellectual education, he hoped to produce people whose ""conscience is filled throughout their bodies"" by promoting ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel."
"Monuments bearing this sentiment inscribed in his handwriting exist at various schools, including Doshisha University."
"Inscribed on this monument to conscience is the phrase, ""A strong conscience will arise that fills the entire body."""
"In addition, the educational ideals for concretely realizing this ""conscience"" education are ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism,"" and through these the school aims to produce people who can serve as the ""conscience of a nation."""
"It is a Christian Protestant school corporation and follows the Congregational Church (United Church)."
"However, its nature is different from so-called mission universities, and its primary purpose is not to spread Christianity (education itself is not used as a means to spread Christianity)."
"This educational institution was formerly known as Doshisha English School, which was founded in 1875 by Niijima Jo, one of the six great educators of the Meiji period."
"In 1875, Yoshida Jo opened the Doshisha English School in Marutamachi, Teramachi, Kyoto."
"In 1876, the temple moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa."
"In April 1877, the Doshisha branch school was opened, and in September it was renamed Doshisha Girls' School."
"1883: Doshisha University rules are established"
"1888: ""The Purpose of Establishing Doshisha University"" was announced in major newspapers and magazines nationwide."
"1896: The school was renamed Doshisha Higher School."
"Doshisha Junior and Senior High School opened."
"1897 M.F. Denton opened Demachi Kindergarten"
"1900: Demachi Kindergarten was renamed Imadegawa Kindergarten."
"1904: Theological seminary and technical college opened under the Technical School Act."

"Ikkyu Sojun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai sect of the Daitokuji school in the Muromachi period."
"He is known as a model for storytelling."
"For ""Ikkyu-san's Witty Tales,"" please see the ""Ikkyu Monogatari"" entry (some information is also provided on this page), and for the TV anime ""Ikkyu-san,"" please see the ""Ikkyu-san"" entry."
"He was born in Kyoto and is said to be the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"In the entry for August 1, 1494, in the diary of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Tobojo Kazunaga-kyoki,"" it is written, ""According to the secret teachings, Ikkyu Sosho was the illegitimate son of Gokomatsu-in."
"There is no one in the world who knows about this."""
"According to later historical sources, his childhood name was Senkikumaru."
"When he grew up, he was called Zhou Jian, and also had other names such as Kyounzi, Katsuro, and Mukei."
"His posthumous name was Sojun, and it can also be written as Sojun."
"Ikkyu is a religious name."
"(For details on posthumous names and religious names, please refer to the ""Posthumous Name"" section.)"
"At the age of six, he became a disciple of Zōgaishūkan at Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and was given the name Shūken."
"He showed talent for poetry from an early age, and the Chinese poems he wrote at the age of 13, ""Nagato Shunsou,"" and at the age of 15, ""Shun'i Yado Hana,"" became famous and were praised throughout Kyoto."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Soi and changed his posthumous name to Sojun."
"At this time, Ikkyu attempted suicide, although it is not clear whether this was due to the passing of his teacher."
"In 1415, he became a disciple of Kaso Sodon, a high priest at Daitokuji Temple in Kyoto."
"In response to the koan ""Tozan's Three Tons of Stick,"" he replied, ""From the world that exists, returning to the world that does not exist, take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."" For this reason, he was given the Buddhist name Ikkyu by Kaso."
"Furthermore, ""aroji (the path of defilement)"" refers to the world of delusion (earthly desires), while ""muroji (the path of no defilement)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddhahood)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly had an epiphany after hearing the cry of a crow."
"Kaso offered to give Ikkyu a letter of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"It is said that Kasou laughed at him and sent him off, calling him a fool."
"From then on he lived a peculiar life, devoted to poetry, kyoka, calligraphy and painting."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving any sons, and Emperor Gohanazono was brought from the Fushiminomiya family and ascended to the throne."
"It is said that Ikkyu was the one who recommended Emperor Gohanazono for his accession to the throne."
"From the ""Chronology of Tokai Ikkyu Sosho."""
"However, Yoshio Imaizumi argues that Emperor Gohanazono's accession to the throne was made possible with the approval of the shogunate and had nothing to do with Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In 1474, after the Onin War, he was appointed as the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and although he did not live at the temple, he worked hard to restore it."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace is an imperial palace located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It was preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10) when the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle) during the Meiji Restoration."
"Since the Meiji period, it has also been called Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official imperial palace in Heian-kyo was the Dairi, located near the center of the city, but it was moved to the Sato Dairi after it fell into disrepair due to wars and other causes."
"Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin Dairi is one of these village dairi, and was the imperial residence of successive generations of the Jimyoin line of imperial family, which would later be known as the Northern Court."
"Incidentally, the imperial residence of the Daikakuji lineage, which would come to be known as the Southern Court, was the Nijo-Tominokoji Imperial Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin Palace, but was expanded based on it."
"Normally you can visit by making a reservation, but in spring and autumn it is open to the public."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until their visit to Tokyo in 1869 (Meiji 2)."
"Currently (in the 21st century), the Kyoto Imperial Palace is national property and is classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to the temple are the Kyoto Omiya Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across Imadegawa-dori to the north are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both schools have the Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto-Omiya Imperial Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace are managed by the Imperial Household Agency, while the surrounding Kyoto Gyoen National Park is managed by the Ministry of the Environment."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to the area, including Kyoto Gyoen, as ""Gosho."""
"Unlike castles overseas, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high, which has been suggested as reflecting the difference in the closeness that common people have to their rulers (the Emperor and other members of the Imperial family) in the East and the West."
"For example, one of the reasons for this observation is that there was an incident during the French Revolution in which commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king), but this has not occurred in Japan."
"When Heian-kyo was first established, the Imperial Palace was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, northeast of Senbon-Marutamachi intersection near West Japan Railway Company's Nijo Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the Satodairi (villages) and was called Tsuchimikado Higashinotouin-dono (Tsuchimikado Higashinotouin Palace), and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court (Japan) in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six of those times were due to fires), and the current building was rebuilt in the Heian period style in 1855 (Ansei 2) at the end of the Edo period, and is known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In 1877, when Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair less than ten years after his visit to Tokyo, and ordered that the palace be preserved and maintained in its original appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gogakumonsho, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"For generations, the enthronement ceremony has been held in the Shishinden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and even after the emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the old Imperial Household Law enacted in 1889 stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and Daijosai be held in Kyoto, and Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also held their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"In addition, the current Imperial House Law, which was enacted after the Second World War, does not stipulate that the ceremony must be held in Kyoto, and so when the current Emperor ascended to the throne in 1990, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time in history in the main hall of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"The Takamikura, the official throne where the Emperor sits when he ascends to the throne and where his accession is symbolically demonstrated, is located in the Shishinden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, so it was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi"")."
"It is a four-legged gate made of plain wood, with a gabled roof and cypress bark roof, and has one bay between the pillars."
"The gates are only opened on special occasions, such as when the Emperor or other important state guests visit, or when the palace is open to the public."
"The tsuijibei walls on the left and right have five horizontal lines, which also indicate the highest level of formality for a wall."
"Enter through this gate and pass through the vermilion-painted, tiled Jomeimon Gate, and you will see the Shishinden Hall directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional form of music found in Japan, China, the Korean peninsula, and Vietnam."
"The following will focus on Japanese gagaku (an important intangible cultural property) as handed down in the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency's Ceremonies Department."
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant music and dance,"" and it is the opposite of ""false music."""
"According to the definition given by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency's Shikibusho, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency, excluding Western music."
"Many of these pieces are instrumental and have been passed down as court music."
"It is the world's oldest style of traditional music still performed in large ensembles today."
"However, the original form of gagaku ensemble music was discontinued for over 100 years after the Onin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered the descendants of musicians (gaku families) and reorganized the form, so it is questionable to what extent it has retained the form from the Heian period."
"When singing the music score for the hichiriki, written in katakana, as a song (a form of memorizing a melody by memorizing it), the pronunciation of the Japanese language from before the 16th century is preserved, such as the pronunciation of the ""ha"" row as ""fa-fi-fu-fe-fo,"" and it is assumed that the song has been reproduced quite faithfully overall."
"Musical scores written in Chinese characters, such as those for the gakubiwa, have many similarities to the biwa music discovered in Dunhuang, China, and also inherit many styles that were transmitted from the ancient continent."
"The most important historical document is the Taigensho, written by Toyohara Muneaki (1450-1512) out of concern that records of gagaku and other arts would be scattered and lost following the Onin War."
"This is a compilation of records about gagaku and bugaku that center on the sho, compiled by the sho musician Tsuneaki, and is a valuable record of gagaku from ancient times."
"It is based on ritual music that was introduced from China, Korea and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku (Japanese court music) was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Togaku, which is said to have been introduced from China, is said to have originated from Yanraku, music that was performed at banquets during the Tang Dynasty."
"In terms of musical categories, there are many international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin'yū music (Champa music), and they also contain elements of traditional Japanese music that predates the introduction of music from the continent."
"Before the modern era, the Tennoji Gakuso of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka City), which retains the oldest style, the Ouchi Gakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara City) were considered to be Sanpo Gakuso."
"In modern times, these gakusho were moved to Tokyo and became the basis for the current Imperial Household Agency's Music Department, but the traditions of each gakusho continue in their respective locations."
"There have also been mutual influences with folk songs and chanting, and a style uniquely Japanese has been created."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are preserved in the Imperial Household Agency's Music Department."
"For lyrics, see ""Kokufu Kabuki"""
"Those that were introduced from outside Japan (Some consider only these to be gagaku.)"
"Left Dance and Tang Music: From China, Tenjiku (India), and Linyi (South Vietnam)"
"Right-wing dance and Goryeo music: Korean and Bohai (northeastern China)"
"These also include songs (Honkaku) produced in Japan that imitate the above styles."
"Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono)"
"For lyrics, see s Utamono."
"*Kokufu Kabuki and Utaimono are sometimes collectively referred to as Kodai Kayo."
"Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan."
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737 as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Konin)."
"His mother, Takano no Niigasa, is recorded in the Shoku Nihongi (Chronicles of Japan) as a descendant of the royal family of Baekje, whose ancestor was King Muryeong of Baekje."
"By Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro, he had the titles Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), and by his wife Fujiwara no Tabiko, he had the title Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Prince Shirakabe, ascended to the throne, he was not expected to become crown prince because his mother, Takano no Niigasa, was from a low-ranking naturalized clan, the Kazu clan. Instead, he aimed to advance in the ranks of the bureaucrats, and held various positions including Chamberlain, University Chief, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan and others, his half-brother, former Crown Prince Prince Tato, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed, and he was made Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Disgusted by the growing influence of the Nara Buddhist temples in Heijo-kyo, he moved the capital to Yamashiro Province."
"First, Nagaoka-kyo was built in 784, and then Heian-kyo was built in 794."
"He also sent an army headed by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as Shogun to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Otsugu of the Fujiwara Ceremonial Family for his military and construction work, claiming that it was causing suffering to the peasants."
"In terms of culture, he is said to have come up with the idea of compiling the Shoku Nihongi."
"It was during the reign of Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang and brought new movement to Japanese Buddhism."
"He also had a dark side, with the unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Tato, and the fact that at the beginning of his reign, his younger brother Prince Sawara, whom he had made crown prince, was exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, and died in exile."
"Fearing vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously named Emperor Sudō, the tomb of Princess Inoue was posthumously named Yamaryō, and she was restored to the position of empress."
"While he was known as the protector of Saicho and Kukai, he also oppressed the various sects known as the ""Nara Six Schools of Buddhism"" by confiscating their fiefs, as he felt that existing Buddhism had become too involved in the government and had too much power."
"It is also said that there was chaos in the harem, which became the breeding ground for the later ""Kusuko Incident."""
"He passed away on March 17, 806 (the 25th year of the Enryaku era)."
"He was given the Japanese posthumous name Yamatoneko Amatsuhitsuki Iyaderi no Mikoto."
"At the same time, he was given the Chinese-style posthumous name Emperor Kanmu."
"He was also called Emperor Kashiwabara and Tenkuni Oshihatomi Kashiwabara Emperor."
"His tomb is said to be Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City."
"During his lifetime, he insisted on being buried in Utano, but due to divination and other reasons, it was decided that he would be buried in the Kashiwara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
"In the Meiji era, he was enshrined at Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo."
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Mausoleum, one of the three palace shrines in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, at his customary press conference before the Emperor's birthday, Akihito made the following comment regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea because it is recorded in the Shoku Nihongi that Emperor Kanmu's birth mother was a descendant of King Muryeong of Baekje."""
"Although this comment did not receive much coverage in Japan, it was widely reported in the Korean media and became a hot topic."
"Some of the reports made huge leaps in logic, such as ""the Imperial family is of Korean descent"" and ""the Imperial family originated from Baekje."""
"The Otani family is the family name of the descendants of Kakue, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking nobleman in Kyoto, and Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (hoshu) of Hongan-ji Temple, the majority branch of the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji period, the chief priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji school (Nishi Honganji) and the chief priest of the Shinshu Otani school (Shinshu Honbyo), which split off from it in 1602, both adopted the surname."
"The origin of the Otani surname comes from the fact that the mausoleum of Shinran (mentioned below) was established in Otani, at the north gate of Chion-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"During the Sengoku period (Japan), with the spread of the Ikko Ikki uprising, Hongan-ji Temple had influence comparable to that of the Sengoku daimyo, and was therefore counted as one of them. Also, the head priest's Buddhist name (Jodo Shinshu) or given name is often referred to as ""Hongan-ji Kennyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Mitsusa,"" but this is merely for convenience; the family line of the head priest of Hongan-ji Temple did not use Hongan-ji as the family name or surname, nor did there exist a clan called the Hongan-ji clan."
"Kakushinni was with Shinran at his deathbed in 1262, and in 1272 built a hall to house his remains in Otani, near her home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"The Otani Hall became the Otani Mausoleum, revered by followers of the Jodo Shinshu sect as the tomb of Shinran, and Kakushinni's eldest son, Kakue, was put in charge of managing it as its caretaker."
"However, because the Otani Mausoleum attracted pilgrimages and donations from followers from all over the country, a dispute later arose between Kakue's son Kakunyo and Kakue's half-brother Yuizen over the position of caretaker, with Kakunyo barely winning and establishing the hereditary succession of the position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the shrine into a temple, and Otani Honganji was born."
"Since then, Hongan-ji Temple, which was succeeded by Kakunyo's descendants, continued to form a religious organization, and during the Muromachi period, under the fifth head priest, Shakunyo, it expanded into the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the seventh head priest, Zonnyo, the Hongan-ji sect had been formed in Kaga Province, Noto Province, Echizen Province, Omi Province, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu sect sect branches that had been working to establish religious organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the religious organization was delayed significantly, and in the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji Temple was considered a branch temple of Shoren-in Temple, and it is said that the Otani family also served as stewards for the Kujo family due to their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's real family)."
"In the second half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan through the efforts of its eighth head priest, Rennyo. In 1465, however, Otani Honganji was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to Yamashina Ward on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of religious influence during the reign of Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki uprising broke out in 1488, and the Kaga Honganji sect drove out the guardian Togashi clan, creating a situation that came to be known as ""a country ruled by the peasants."""
"For about 100 years, until 1580, the country came to be ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Hongan-ji sect increased its activities throughout Japan, leveraging the organizational strength of its members, from small farmers to local samurai and local lords and other warrior classes. However, Yamashina Hongan-ji was destroyed in the Tenbun-Hokke Rebellion in 1532, and the 10th head priest, Shonyo, moved to Ishiyama Gobo, which had been founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and named it Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
"Ishiyama Honganji Temple was located on top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau."
"They controlled Osaka, a key river transportation point at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Using Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple as his base, Shonyo worked to build closer ties with various feudal lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji Temple."
"On the other hand, from the end of Shonyo's time, within the Honganji sect in local areas, such as the Hokuriku region, there were some who were breaking away from the control of Honganji and pursuing their own path."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head of the Hongan-ji sect, Kennyo, the sect had become a de facto independent feudal lord power, and advanced into the Kinai region, coming into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to seize feudal power from the religious forces and establish unified rule."
"The conflict between the Hongan-ji Temple and the Oda clan, known as the Ishiyama War, which lasted for ten years from 1570, saw the Hongan-ji Temple gain the upper hand due to the cooperation between Kennyo and his followers who holed up in the fortified Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple and the Hongan-ji Temple followers who were waging resistance movements against the Oda clan in various places, causing great trouble for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-Ikki rebels, who had recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan, were defeated, weakening resistance in various places. In 1578, the navy of the Mori clan, who were allied with Hongan-ji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizugawa River, and the Hongan-ji Temple suffered repeated defeats outside the Hongan-ji Temple."
"Although Hongan-ji continued to maintain its strength by gathering support from the Saika-shu and others, it gradually became isolated among its enemies, and finally, in 1580, it gave in to Nobunaga, who obtained an imperial order from Emperor Ogimachi, and left Ishiyama Hongan-ji, and Hongan-ji as a feudal lord was eliminated."
"At this time, Kennyo's eldest son, Kyonyo, who insisted on continuing the resistance against Kennyo's wishes, fell out with him, and when Kennyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Junnyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Hongan-ji Temple began to split up over the position of head priest, and in 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu gave Kyonyo a separate temple site from Junnyo's Hongan-ji sect, separating it into Higashi Hongan-ji Temple."
"At this time, many followers from Junnyo's sect, which had become Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyonyo's sect at Higashi Honganji, and Honganji was split into East and West."
"The heads of the Eastern and Western Otani families, who were originally descended from Shinran, the son of the noble Hino Arinori, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), had a tradition of being adopted by influential nobles for generations, and they had also intermarried with nobles for generations, so they also became nobles through the maternal line."
"Kyotanabe City is a city located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, near the border with Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture."
"Kyotanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki County, Seika Town in Soraku County, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, and is in the center of a triangle between the three prefectures."
"The city is sandwiched between the Kizu River (Kyoto Prefecture), which flows north-south on the east side of the city, and the Ikoma mountain range on the west side, and the West Japan Railway Company Katamachi Line and Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway Company run through the center of the city."
"It has a strong character as a bedroom town for Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka."
"On April 1, 1997, the city was incorporated from Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki County."
"It was the 12th city established in Kyoto Prefecture in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"At that time, in order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuku County, Kyoto Prefecture, which had become ""Kyoto Tanabe City"" by adding the ""Kyoto"" part of Kyoto Prefecture, was made into a city (implementation of city ordinances), and the name of the city was changed from ""Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" to ""Kyoto Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" on the same day."

"In addition, local trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shintanabe Station."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe, but was renamed to match the city's name around the same time that the city was incorporated."
"This is a similar case to Nishimukō Station and Higashimukō Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line."
"(There is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, but the reason that the station in Tanabe City has the old name of Wakayama Prefecture, ""Kii,"" in its name is thought to be to avoid duplication of station names within the jurisdiction of the same West Japan Railway Company.)"

"Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan in 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu."
"Heian-kyo was built on land that straddled the districts of Kazuno and Atago in Yamashiro Province, which is now the center of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture, and was a rectangular capital city measuring 4.5 km east to west and 5.2 km north to south."
"The plan was to set up the Daidairi in the center of the northern end of the capital, and then run Suzaku-oji Avenue through the center of the city, with Sakyo and Ukyo on either side (the east side was Sakyo and the west side was Ukyo)."
"The floor plan is basically modeled after Heijo-kyo and Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"But there were no walls."
"There is a theory that the selection of this site was based on the idea of the Four Gods' Correspondence, which is based on Feng Shui, a method introduced from China."
"The area of Heian-kyo was smaller than the current city of Kyoto."
"The northernmost Ichijo-oji street is located halfway between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The southernmost point, Kujo-oji, is currently Kujo-dori, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
"The eastern limit of the road, Tokyo Kyokuoji Street, corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street."
"The estimated location of the westernmost Nishikyogoku-oji is a line that connects Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the San'in Main Line of the West Japan Railway Company and Nishikyogoku Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line of the Hankyu Railway Company from north to south."
"The capital was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 jo (approximately 120 m) on each side by main roads and alleys running north, south, east and west."
"A group of four rows of towns arranged in an east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern side) is called a ""jo"", and a group of four rows arranged in a north-south direction is called a ""bo""."
"Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district or district was given a number."
"As a result, each town came to be called something like ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jushicho."""
"Even the smaller roads were about 4 jo (about 12 m) wide, while the main roads were more than 8 jo (about 24 m) wide."
"Existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places."
"Suzaku-oji was 28 jo (approximately 84 m) wide."
"In addition, a river (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishihorikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
"In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province and built Nagaoka-kyo."
"However, it is said that the intention was to create a new capital for the lineage of Emperor Tenchi, away from Yamato Province, where the influence of the aristocrats and temples that had supported the government of Emperor Tenmu was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later, in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province and established Heian-kyo."
"This relocation of the capital is thought to have been influenced by a series of disturbances that occurred in Nagaoka-kyo, from the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu to the dethronement of Prince Sawara as crown prince, as well as the slow progress of construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
"It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo began with the Imperial Palace (the Daidairi), followed by the construction of Kyoto (the city center)."
"However, since Ukyo is a marshland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), residential development did not progress even in the 9th century."
"By the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become almost a mere formality, the land had fallen into disrepair and was even converted into farmland, something that was actually prohibited within Kyoto."
"Residential areas for the aristocracy were located in Sakyo, with the exception of the northern part of Ukyo, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Shoki is an imperially commissioned historical work compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the Six National Histories, following the Shoku Nihongi."
"It was completed in the 7th year of the Jowa era (Japan) (840) and covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tencho era (833)."
"The editors are Fujiwara Otsugu and others."
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of the Kōnin era (819), Emperor Saga issued an imperial command ordering FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu, FUJIWARA no Otsugu, FUJIWARA no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine no Yasuyo to compile the book."
"As all three except Otsugu died before the work was completed, Emperor Junna later issued an imperial decree ordering KIYOHARA no Natsuno, Prince Naoyo, FUJIWARA no Yoshino, ONO no Minemori, SAKANOUE no Imanatsugu, and SHIMADA no Kiyota to continue the work."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, he issued a further imperial decree ordering Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Katori to carry out the plan."
"Later, he added Furu Takataniwa and Yamada Furutsugu, and finally reported its completion on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841)."
"The compilation of the book took 21 years, and Fujiwara no Otsugu was the only person involved throughout the project, which spanned three generations of emperors."
"It follows on from the ""Shoku Nihongi"" and records the reigns of Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Until the beginning of the 15th century, all 40 volumes were in existence, but they were subsequently lost and were finally published when a 10-volume copy was discovered by Inayama Gyōkyō, a disciple of Hanawa Hokiichi, at the Sanjōnishi residence (there is also a different theory that it is a revised version by Yanagiwara Norimitsu)."
"The remaining parts are 10 volumes: volumes 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kanmu), 14 and 17 (Heijō), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), but the volume for Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"The text can be reconstructed to some extent from quotations in the Nihon Kiryaku, an abridged version of the Six National Histories, and the Ruiju Kokushi, a classification of the Six National Histories."
"""Nihon Iritashi"" and ""Nihon Koki Iritashi"" are collections of lost writings from various places, and based on these, the following Japanese historical materials translated and annotated by Shueisha and Kodansha Academic Library have been published."
"It is said that Fujiwara no Otsugu's opinions were most strongly reflected in the contents of the document."
"The inclusion of short biographies (薨伝) in the obituaries of emperors and courtiers follows the example of the Shoku Nihongi and is the same as subsequent historical works."
"However, this book's biography does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but contains many interesting descriptions that include unique criticism and impressions, making it unique among the Six National Histories in that it maintains a critical spirit."
"It is also known that among the Six National Histories, it contains more waka poetry than the historical works that came before and after it."
"Sei Shonagon (c. 966? - c. 1025?) was a female author and poet of the Heian period."
"There is a theory that her real name was Kiyohara Nagiko, but this is unknown."
"She was the later daughter of the famous poet Kiyohara Gensuke (908-990), who was one of the ""Five People of the Pear Pot."""
"There is an old legend that his mother was ""Higaki no Ouna"" who appears in the ""Gosen Wakashu"", but this is nothing more than an absurd theory."
"His great-grandfather (some say his grandfather) was KIYOHARA no Fukayabu, a representative poet of the Kokin Wakashū (Collection of Poems)."
"His siblings included Gagaku no Kami Tamenari, Dazai Shokan Tsunenobu, Kazan-in Denjo Hoshi Kaihide, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Rinori (brother of Fujiwara no Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" was the name of a lady-in-waiting, ""Sei"" was taken from the Kiyohara family name, and ""Shonagon"" was taken from the title of a relative."
"Her real name is unknown, and there is a theory that she was named ""Nagiko"" (from ""The Pillow Book""), but this is not credible."
"She is counted among the Thirty-six Immortal Poets of the Middle Ages, and is known to have left behind a small collection of 42 poems, the ""Sei Shonagon Collection"" (the number of poems varies according to variant versions; the most widely used version has 31 poems)."
"Fourteen of his poems are included in imperial anthologies, including ""Goshui Wakashu."""
"Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate and the last Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reigned: 1568 (Eiroku 11) - 1588 (Tensho 16))."
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate."
"His mother was Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, was his older brother."
"He was originally a Buddhist monk, but after Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of shogunate officials such as Hosokawa Yusai."
"He was then supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and travelled to Kyoto, where he became the 15th Shogun."
"He eventually came into conflict with Nobunaga, and joined forces with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to form an alliance to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, he cornered Nobunaga, but he was eventually banished from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate was effectively destroyed."
"He spent the rest of his life receiving support from Mori Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Since he had an older brother, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, who was to become the heir, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (at Ichijo-in Temple, Kofuku-ji Temple) under the name Kakukei."
"He later rose to the position of Gonshosozu at Kofuku-ji Temple."
"In the Eiroku Incident of 1565, his elder brother Yoshiteru, who was the 13th Shogun, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Triumvirate, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Sukata, who was the head priest of Rokuon-in Temple, was also assassinated."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and imprisoned in Kofuku-ji Temple (Hisahide and others are said to have only imprisoned Yoshiaki because they feared that killing Kakuei would antagonize Kofuku-ji Temple, as Kakuei was the shogun's younger brother and had been promised the position of head priest of Kofuku-ji Temple in the future)."
"However, he escaped with the help of shogunate officials such as Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"Books about Yoshiaki state that the palace was also known by the nickname ""Buke Gosho."""
"When he was chased out of Kyoto, he was attacked by thieves in the night, and he was also called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Junior Fifth Rank and Left Horse Captain."
"Although there are some opinions questioning the time of the investiture, according to ""Tokitsugu-kyoki"" by Tokitsugu Yamashina, on the day that Yoshiaki's rival Yoshihide ASHIKAGA was proclaimed shogun in February 1568, Tokitsugu was confused when an emissary from Yoshiaki appeared at his residence, who was the emissary of the proclamation, and asked him to act as an intermediary in recommending him for promotion to Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, so it is clear that he was invested before that."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki initially sought refuge with the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu, in Omi Province, but after Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Triumvirate, he fled to his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshimune, in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, due to feuds over succession and power struggles among senior vassals, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have the power to travel to Kyoto, so in September, they defected to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo of the Kurayama Palace, a branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and had no intention of actively accompanying Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had just returned to secular life, to Kyoto, so the trip did not materialize."
"The role of kakan was played by Yoshikage ASAKURA (Note: there is no documented historical evidence that Yoshiaki had formally come of age up until this point, so it can be said that this was far too late for the time)."
"Eventually, through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province, seeking refuge with Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he was proclaimed shogun by the Imperial Court and became the 15th shogun."
"At the same time, he was promoted and appointed to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Councilor, and Vice-Captain of the Left Guard."
"The JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the Tokaido Main Line operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station."
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"Almost the entire route runs parallel to the Hankyu Railway's Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line), and Kintetsu Railway also has the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which connects with Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively, so the nickname ""JR"" is added to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and since it is positioned as the company's main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color is used as the line color."
"It runs parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line on the right bank of the Yodo River, and the limited rapid service covers the 42.8 km between Kyoto and Osaka in as little as 28 minutes (maximum speed is 130 km/h)."
"The entire section is quadruple tracked in different directions (outer and inner lines)."
"J-Thru, ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and Thru Kansai PiTaPa can be used at all stations on the JR Kyoto Line."
"The Hanwa Line traffic control system has been introduced on the entire line."
"It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line."
"In addition to special rapid service trains, rapid service trains, and local trains (Keihanshin local lines) that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, there are also limited express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, Sanin region, and other areas."
"In addition, nearly half of the local trains run to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the takeover by JR, the sleeper express to Kyushu, which had departed from Shin-Osaka, the express to Nanki, which had departed from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" to Sanin, which had started operation with the opening of the Chizu Express, were newly operated directly to Kyoto, and the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"In particular, the Haruka (train), which began operation at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, became a regular train service to Kyoto one year later, and the Shin-Osaka to Kyoto route became a limited express highway with about four trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound ""Raicho (train)"" limited express."
"All sleeper express trains departing from Kyoto and heading to Kyushu were discontinued with the timetable change on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the outbound express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that run from Shin-Osaka via the Osaka Loop Line to the Hanwa Line enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (third departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"As a result, the journey takes slightly longer than express and special rapid trains that run on the outer tracks on the same section, and depending on the time of day, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka at the same time."
"The linearity is excellent over almost the entire line between Kyoto and Osaka, and on the outer tracks, except for some curved sections, it is possible to operate at a speed of 130 km/h."
"The inner track can also accommodate 120km/h, but express trains do not run on the inner track (except for out-of-service and special trains)."
"The express trains that run on this section are as follows:"
"In addition, due to the need to enter and leave Mukomachi (Kyoto General Operations Depot), deadhead trains such as the ""Hamakaze (train)"", ""Tamba (train)"" and ""Kitakinki (train)"" run through this section."
"In addition, Thunderbird, Raicho, and Kitaguni trains running between Mukomachi and Osaka pass through the Kitakata Freight Line."
"When a southbound train destined for Osaka enters the Kyoto General Operations Depot, it heads south from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kitakata Freight Line from the west, and then joins the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (when leaving the depot, it takes the reverse route)."
"Therefore, when the train is entering or leaving the depot, the front and back of the train are reversed."
"Special rapid service trains run directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Aboshi and Kamigori on the Sanyo Main Line, and Banshu Ako on the Ako Line via the JR Kyoto Line to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Omi-Shiotsu Station on the Hokuriku Main Line, and Tsuruga."
"From daytime to night, trains run every 15 minutes, with one train heading towards Kyoto during the day running on the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly on the Biwako Line."
"At night, all four trains run directly to the Biwako Line."
"All trains will be made using JR West 223 series 1000 and JR West 223 series 2000 electric trains, and will consist of 8 or 12 cars."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478) that is approximately 100 km long and starts in Kumiyama Town, Kuze District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ends in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It runs through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, strengthening cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture and revitalizing the region, while also serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto City metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections have been opened: the starting point, the central section, and the end point. The starting point opened under the name Keiji Bypass rather than the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"In addition, the term ""Kyoto Jukan Expressway"" is often used to refer to the Kyoto-Tamba Road alone."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side will not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway as the Tottori Toyooka-Miyazu Expressway, a regional expressway."
"In addition, the section from Kumiyama Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a national expressway, so a minimum speed limit applies and it is not possible for small express vehicles to pass through."
"For this reason, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and the Maizuru Oe IC."
"Special vehicles over 2.5m wide cannot pass through."
"Toll road section (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Co., Ltd.)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, so it is not possible to drive only on the toll-free section."
"The section from Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open in summer to fall of 2008, will come under the management of the Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation. At the same time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT will also come under the management of the Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation, and therefore the section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, which is currently free, will also become a toll section."
"In line with this, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) will be demolished and the new Ayabe Ankokuji toll gate will be built."
"(There is currently no toll gate at Ayabe-Ankokuji IC.) As a result, there will be no toll gates on the main line of the Ayabe-Miyazu Road."
"The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) is constructed in a temporary prefabricated structure."
"The section between Tanba IC and Kyotanba Wachi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in fiscal 2014, but it is not yet clear what the management system will be after it opens."
"February 17, 1988: National Highway No. 9 Oinosaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and National Highway No. 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary toll road."
"May 6, 1993: The section between Kutsukake IC and Chiyokawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC opened as a general toll road."
"March 8, 1998: With the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Oe IC, the road connects with the Maizuru Expressway (now the Maizuru-Wakasa Expressway) (temporary two-lane two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: With the privatization of the four road-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Corporation, an independent administrative institution, and management to West Nippon Expressway Company Limited."
"The areas in the IC number column with a background color of ■ indicate sections where the road is already in service."
"In addition, a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicates that the facility is not in service or is not completed."
"The names of the uncompleted sections are tentative."
"The original version has no BS."
"(Numbers) are the numbers of other lines."
"&lt;number&gt; is the schedule number."
"Enryaku-ji Temple is located in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and its grounds cover the entirety of Mount Hiei, which is 848 meters above sea level."
"Because of the name of Enryaku-ji Temple, it is often called Mount Hiei or Mount Eizan."
"Because it was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto), it was also called Hokurei."
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect and was founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
"The chief priest (abbot) is called Tendai Zasu and oversees the branch temples."
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been the center of Heian Buddhism along with Kongobuji Temple on Mount Koya."
"In addition to the teachings of Tendai and the Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (Shikan) and Nembutsu were also practiced, making it resemble a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period it gained great influence, earning the respect of the imperial family and aristocrats."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist rituals and prayers garnered support from Heian aristocrats, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, known as ""Taimitsu,"" competed for supremacy with the esoteric Buddhism (Toumitsu) of the Shingon sect's Toji Temple."
"""Enryaku-ji Temple"" is a collective name for the Three Towers and Sixteen Valleys temples, including the Todo, Saito, and Yokawa, which are scattered within the temple grounds stretching from the top of Mt. Hiei to its eastern foot."
"It began in 788 when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in."
"It was not until the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824) after the death of Saicho that the temple was allowed to use the name Enryaku-ji, which was taken from the era in which it was founded."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced many famous monks, including Ennin and Enchin, who laid the foundations of the Japanese Tendai sect, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nembutsu, Honen, the founder of the Jodo sect, Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, Eisai, the founder of the Rinzai sect, Dogen, the founder of the Soto sect, and Nichiren, the founder of the Nichiren sect. Many of the founders of new Buddhism and famous monks in the history of Japanese Buddhism all trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, and the temple is also known as the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
"Mount Hiei also appears in many literary works."
"Furthermore, strict training such as the ""12-year mountain retreat"" and ""1,000-day pilgrimage"" are still practiced here to this day, and the site is registered as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as one of the most sacred sites in Japanese Buddhism."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the Kojiki, is thought to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times, and Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto on the eastern foot of the mountain enshrines Oyamakui-no-Mikoto, the local deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho's real name was Mitsunoobitohirono, and he was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (there is also a theory that he was born in 767)."
"In 780, when he was 15 years old, he became a monk under the monk Gyohyo of the Omi Kokubunji Temple and took the name Saicho."
"In 785, when he was 20 years old, he received the precepts (received the discipline to become an official monk) at Todaiji Temple in Nara and became an official monk."
"The young Saicho, for his own reasons, did not seek a stable position at one of the great temples in Nara, but instead secluded himself to Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, and devoted himself to training and the study of Buddhist scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the greatest among the many Buddhist scriptures, and studied the ""Three Great Sections of the Lotus Sutra"" (""Hokke Gengi,"" ""Hokke Monku,"" and ""Mahasshikan"") written by the Chinese Tendai master Chigi."
"In 788, Saicho built a small temple consisting of a Yakushido Hall, a Monjudo Hall, and a sutra repository at the site of the present-day Konponchudo Hall, and named it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieisan-ji Temple, and it was not until the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824) that it was allowed to use the name ""Enryaku-ji,"" a reference to the era in which it was founded."
"The then Emperor Kanmu became a follower of Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close aides, the Wake clan, Hiei-san Temple gradually came to flourish as a training center for protecting the nation, guarding against the evil spirits of Kyoto (northeast)."
"In 802, Saicho was allowed to travel to Tang China as a returning student (a short-term overseas trainee)."
"In 804, he traveled to Tang China on a Japanese envoy ship."
"Saicho traveled to the sacred Mount Tiantai, where he learned Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from Priest Dozui, a direct descendant of the Great Master Tiantai Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from Abbot Gyoman."
"He also studied esoteric Buddhism under Ajari Shunkyou and Zen under Zen Master Shakunen at Ryukoji Temple in Yue Province (Shaoxing)."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, he is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"He is generally thought to be the deified moon and the god who rules over the night, but there are other theories (see below)."
"Her name can also be pronounced Tsukiyomi."
"Because there is a story in the Nihon Shoki in which he kills Ukemochi-no-kami, he is generally thought to be a male deity, but there is no description in the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki that determines his gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often a goddess, and furthermore, goddesses with warlike personalities often appear in the myths of other countries, so some scholars advocate the theory that it is a goddess, as the story of Ukemochikami's murder cannot be used to definitively conclude that it was a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is said to be the god of the moon, but there are various differences in the sources regarding his deity."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he fled from Yomi and performed a purification ritual, and together with Amaterasu, who was born from the other eye, and Susanoo, who was born from his nose, they form one of the three noble children."
"On the other hand, the Nihon Shoki contains a story that, contrary to the Kojiki, he was born from the left eye, and another that he grew from a copper-nickel mirror held in his right hand, and his domain of rule was not fixed, including the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi was born as a pair with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it has been pointed out that similar ideas can be found in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pan Gu (Records of the Five Elements), there is an origin story in which after Pan Gu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon, and in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are said to be twins."
"(However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later times that the two were identified.)"
"In addition, the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament tells of the creation of the sun and the moon, in which on the fourth day after the creation of the heavens and the earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and had them rule over the day and night respectively, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also thought to follow the pattern of the origin stories of the sun and moon common throughout the world, in which the sun and moon were born as a pair."
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered to be as important a god as Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear often in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and generally plays a relatively minor role."
"The origin of grains is only mentioned in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the Nihon Shoki."
"One theory is that this is to balance the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo by placing a god who does nothing between them."
"A similar structure can be seen in Ame-no-Minaka-nushi no Kami relative to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri relative to Hoori (Yamasachihiko) and Hoderi (Umisachihiko)."
"This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology."
"Some people believe that they are the same deity, as their territories and episodes overlap with those of Susanoo."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he was born when Izanagi-no-Mikoto washed his right eye, and is called one of the ""three noble children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto was ordered to ""inform the land of food at night,"" but after this he had no further success."
"There is also a theory that it is the land of Yomi, where the goddess Izanami resides."
"In the fifth section of the Kamiyomitsu section of the Nihon Shoki, the main text simply states that ""He gave birth to the god of the moon, whose brilliance is second only to that of the sun, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, the first volume that follows contains an alternative version, which states that Izanagi-no-Mikoto held a bronze mirror in his left hand and gave birth to Dainichi-no-Mikoto, and held a bronze mirror in his right hand and gave birth to Tsukiyumi-no-Mikoto."
"Regarding their domains of rule, there are several stories in which they are instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu Omikami, while there is also one in which they were commanded to ""control the eight hundredfold tides of the ocean"" (this appears to be based on the idea that the moon controls the tides), and there are multiple parallel stories about the birth of the three gods."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth section of the Nihon Shoki, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were ordered to rule the heavens together, but later Tsukiyomi no Mikoto received an order from Amaterasu to meet Ukemochi in the heavens, and so he descended to meet Ukemochi."
"So Ukemochikami spit rice out of her mouth as a treat, which made Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto angry, calling it ""filthy,"" and so he killed Ukemochikami with his sword, according to the myth."
"Cattle, horses, silkworms, rice, and other crops were born from Ukemochi-no-kami's corpse, which became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (or Onmyoji) was one of the government positions held by the Onmyo-ryo of the Ministry of Central Affairs under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"This refers to a position that was initially assigned to perform divination and geomantic divination using Onmyodo, which is based on the ideas of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, and later came to be in charge of divination, sorcery, and rituals in general, going beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has come to refer to non-official individuals who personally perform divination, magic, and rituals among the general public in various regions, and in modern times it is defined as a type of Shinto priest who offers private prayers and divination among the general public."
"It can also be pronounced ""onyouji"" without the joint voice."
"The idea of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, which states that all phenomena are made up of a combination of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, began in the ancient Xia and Shang dynasties in China and was largely completed by the Zhou dynasty. Closely related to this idea are astronomy, calendars, the I Ching, and clocks. These ideas were introduced to Japan during the Asuka period from the 5th to 6th centuries, either directly from mainland China (Han and Sui) or via the western region of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje), at the latest by 512 (the 7th year of the reign of Emperor Keitai) when a doctor of the Five Classics came to Japan from Baekje in 554 (the 15th year of the reign of Emperor Kinmei)."
"Initially, these studies only had a small influence on politics and culture, but in 602 (the 10th year of the reign of Empress Suiko), Kanroku, who could be called the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came to Japan from Baekje and lectured on these subjects to 34 selected government officials, including Prince Shotoku, and began to have a major impact on Japan's national politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (the Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in 607 (the 15th year of the reign of Empress Suiko), envoys were sent to Sui, an advanced and civilized country, to absorb Buddhism, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, and calendar systems. The influence of the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy was also evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution and the Twelve Ranks of Caps."
"After that, the Imperial Court continued to absorb further knowledge by having students accompany the envoys sent to Sui (and later to Tang) and by inviting many monks and scholars from mainland China or from ports on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula where the envoys made port calls."
"As various studies were introduced in Japan, it became important to ""consider the movements and positions of the sun, moon, and stars, and use the five elements theory of mutual generation and mutual inhibition to determine good and bad fortune, predict the future, and obtain guidelines for all aspects of human life,"" and the yin-yang and five elements theory came to be emphasized as a method of judging good and bad fortune and obtaining a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was such an expert in astronomy and had such a deep knowledge of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements that he personally took up a scroll to read fortunes during the Jinshin War, established the Onmyoryo and Japan's first divining observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"In 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the idea of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements became more popular. In 718, the Yoro Code stipulated the establishment of the Onmyoryo as a bureau (ritsuryo system) within the Ministry of Central Affairs, and it was stipulated that a doctor of astronomy, a doctor of Yin-Yang, an Onmyoji, a doctor of calendars, and a doctor of water clocks be permanently appointed as technical officials. As a result, they came to be in charge of official divination, alongside the tortoise divination of the Jingikan."
"As the position was responsible for technologies that had been brought over from the continent, the appointed doctors and onmyoji were immigrants who were knowledgeable in various fields and skilled in interpreting classical Chinese, and were generally learned monks who had returned from the Former Han and Later Han dynasties of mainland China, the Sui dynasty which took over as hegemony on the continent, Goguryeo and Baekje which had influence on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally Silla which had originally been a power on the east coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, around the time when Silla unified the Korean Peninsula and the Baekje dynasty was destroyed after Japan sent reinforcements to Baekje, an allied nation, in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 (the 2nd year of the Tenchi era), a large number of knowledgeable people came to Japan as refugees from Baekje, and many of them were appointed to government posts."
"When the Onmyoryo was first established, its duties were limited to divination, geomantic divination (similar to what is now called feng shui), celestial observation, astrology, creating calendars, judging auspicious and inauspicious days, and water clocks; therefore, it was limited to astronomical observation, calendar management, and prediction of good and bad luck for events through theoretical analysis based on yin-yang and the five elements; it did not perform any religious rites or incantations like the Shinto priests or monks. However, it played an important role in selecting auspicious days for repairs at the Imperial Court, and in divining the good and bad luck of land and directions when the capital was moved, for example."
"The structure of the Onmyoryo as a Ritsuryo official system and the duties of onmyoji"
"The Onmyo-ryo had administrative officers as its administrative officers."
"The position was responsible for overseeing the Onmyo-ryo, overseeing all matters related to astronomy, calendars, weather, and mood, and for recording and sealing away any abnormal occurrences without them being leaked to the public and reporting them in strict secrecy (Astronomical Secret Reports), submitting the new year's calendar created by the calendar expert by November 1st each year (Rekisho), and also reporting the results of divination and geomantic readings on a regular basis."
"His official rank was Junior Fifth Rank."
"He served as an assistant to the Onmyo-no-kami."
"He inspected the dormitory and managed general administrative duties, including reviewing documents."
"I performed record-keeping procedures such as writing and reading out official documents."
"He assisted the Chief of Onmyō Department in record-keeping duties."
"As a technical officer,"
"He is an instructor who observes astronomy signs and seals any abnormalities to prevent them from leaking out, and also provides guidance to 10 astronomy trainees."
"He was ranked seventh lower and was given a higher rank than other professors because astronomy was considered the most difficult of the various arts of Yin and Yang."
"An instructor who trains 10 Onmyo students."
"It is set at a high rank, similar to that of a Doctor of Astronomy and the Lower Seventh Rank."
