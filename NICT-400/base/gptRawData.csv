"The words ""may the spirit of righteousness embody this monument"" are inscribed on this monument."
"Furthermore, as the educational philosophy to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, ""Christianity"", ""liberalism"", and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to cultivate individuals as the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
"It is a school corporation of Protestant Christianity, following the tradition of congregationalist (union) church."
"However, it is different in nature from so-called mission-oriented universities and does not have Christian evangelism as its primary purpose (does not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."

Ikkyu Sojun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school in the Rinzai Zen Daikoku-ji sect during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of eloquence.
"Regarding ""Ikkyu-san no Tonchi Banashi,"" refer to the ""Ikkyu Banashi"" section (there is also some description on this page). For the TV anime ""Ikkyu-san,"" refer to the ""Ikkyu-san"" section."
Born in Kyoto and said to be a descendant of Emperor Go-Komatsu.
"In the diary of Sugawara and Nagatada, in the entry for the first day of August in the third year of Meio (1494), it is written, ""It is said in a secret transmission that the monk Ikkyu is a prince of the Empress Dowager's illegitimate child."""
There is no one in the world who knows this.
"According to later historical records, his childhood name was Senkiku Maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and went by the aliases Kuang Yunzi, Xialu, and Mukei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shujun, also written as Shunjun."
Ikyu is a Buddhist title.
"Regarding the posthumous Buddhist name and temple name, please refer to the section on ""Posthumous Buddhist Name"" for more information."
"At the age of six, he entered the statue identification collection at Ankokuzan in Kyoto, took the vows, and was named Zhou Jian."
"From an early age, he showed exceptional talent in poetry. His Chinese poems, ""Spring Grass in Nagato"" composed at the age of 13 and ""Flowers Blooming on Spring Garments"" composed at the age of 15, gained praise and became well-known in the capital."
"In the 17th year of Ōei (1410), at the age of 17, became a disciple of Kenou Soui and changed his Buddhist name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's behavior is caused by his master's departure, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Oei (1415), he became a disciple of Kanso Sodon, a high priest of Daikoku-ji in Kyoto."
"He was given the Buddhist name ""Ikkyu"" from a riddle known as ""Three Blows of Dongsan's Stick,"" when he responded with: ""Returning from the place where there is no passing, taking a rest; when it rains, let it rain; when the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Arroji (arero-ji)"" refers to the world of delusion (suffering), while ""muroji (muro-ji)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddhahood)."
"One night in the 27th year of Oei (1420), I suddenly realized upon hearing the cry of a crow."
"The old man tried to give a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"It is said that the elderly man sent him off with a laugh, calling him a fool."
"After that, I lived a life of poetry, tanka, calligraphy, and craziness."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Gokomatsu passed away leaving no male heirs, and Emperor Jōkō from the Fushimi-no-miya family was welcomed and enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Chronology of Ikkyu Sojun of the East Sea""."
"However, Tadashio Imanami argues that the ascension of Emperor Go-Toba was endorsed by the shogunate and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era following the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado and despite not residing in the temple, he made great efforts for its revival."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"As a result of the Tokyo procession during the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), where it has been preserved since the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it also came to be known as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to Rini-no-Miya due to damage from wars and other causes."
"The Togu-in Palace in the Doi Palace was one of the palaces in this capital where the imperial family of the Jomyo-in line, later called the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at Nijo Tominokoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the equivalent of the former Imperial Palace of the Eastern Toin-doin, but rather an expansion based on the former Eastern Toin-doin Imperial Palace."
"Normally, it is possible to visit by applying, but it is also open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the move of the imperial capital to Tokyo in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is a national property classified as ""Imperial property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sento Imperial Palace, and across Imadegawa Street to the north is Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both located on Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the surrounding national park."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace as just ""Gosho."""
"There is a theory that the relatively low walls surrounding the Imperial Palace, unlike the high walls around castles in other countries, symbolize the difference in the people's familiarity with their rulers (emperors and imperial family) between the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This is one of the reasons why such incidents have not occurred in Japan."
"In the beginning when Heian-kyo was first established, the Imperial Palace was located significantly to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the JR Nijo Station in the northwest corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences located within the Imperial Palace grounds, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashitoin Palace. It was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of the Genko era (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was here has been rebuilt eight times only during the Edo period (six of which were rebuilt due to fire), and the existing building was reconstructed in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855) following the Heian style, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of the Meiji era (1877), when Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Tokyo Imperial Palace, visited Kyoto, he lamented the deterioration of the Kyoto Imperial Palace within 10 years after his visit to Tokyo, and ordered that the palace be preserved and its old appearance be maintained."
"Some of the main buildings include the Shishin-den, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's residence."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally conducted at the Shishin-den Hall in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, as stipulated by the pre-Meiji Constitution established in 1889, the enthronement ceremony and Daijosai were to be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Also, there are no specific provisions in the current Imperial Household Law enacted after World War II specifying that the enthronement ceremony must take place in Kyoto. In 1990, for the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony for the current Emperor was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"At the time of the enthronement, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor where the symbolic enthronement takes place, located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Sokui no Rei"" (equivalent to the ""Shishin-den no Gi"") was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
It is a four-legged gate made of plain wood with a gabled roof and a cypress bark roof.
"The gate is only opened for special events such as the visit of the Emperor or important foreign guests, or for public viewing."
"In the left and right Tsuijibei walls, there are five lines (horizontal lines) included, showing the highest level of formality as a wall."
"When you pass through this gate and walk under the vermilion-lacquered tiled Shouming Gate, you will see the front of the Purple Chamber Hall."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music from Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following describes Japanese Gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu (Important Intangible Cultural Property).
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" in contrast to ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency excluding Western music."
Many have been passed down as court music in instrumental works.
It is the world's oldest form of traditional music that is still performed in large ensemble formats today.
"However, as a traditional form of orchestral music, gagaku had been discontinued for over 100 years after the Onin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of musicians (gakka) to reorganize it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the form from the Heian period has been passed down."
"When singing a piece of music written in katakana for the biwa, it is speculated that the pronunciation of 16th century Japanese is faithfully preserved, such as pronouncing the Ha row as Fafa, Fifi, Fu, Fe, and Fo."
"The pieces written in kanji, such as those on the notation of the Raku biwa, share many similarities with the biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and also inherit many styles that were passed down from even older continents."
"One of the most important historical documents is the ""Taigen-sho"" written by Toyohara Noriaki (1450-1512) out of concern that records of gagaku music and other cultural assets were being lost during the Onin War."
"This is a compilation of records by Tsunaki Tōhika, an expert in Sho music, on gagaku and bugaku with sho at the center. It is a valuable record on ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music that was transmitted from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yue was music performed during ceremonies."
"However, among the songs currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music that was performed at a banquet called Yan music in Tang."
"In terms of musical categories, various names with international colors such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (music of Champa) are transmitted, including elements of traditional Japanese music from before the introduction of continental music."
"Before modern times, the original style of music was transmitted through the Sanbangari no Gakusho of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Ouchi Gakusho of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakusho of Kasuga Shrine (Nara), which were collectively known as the Sanpo Gakusho."
"These musical places came to be called Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency, and the traditions of each musical place continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences can be seen between min'yo and shomyo, and Japan's unique style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been passed down to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Shoku Gakubu."
Refer to the lyrics of s-style music and dance in S country.
There is a belief that the only thing that can be considered gagaku is something that has been transmitted from outside Japan.
"Left dance, Tang music... China, India (Tianzhu), and Linyi (South Vietnam) origins."
"Right-hand dance, Goryeo music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) related materials"
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above-mentioned style (Japanese music).
Song composed during the Heian period
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes ancient songs and recitations are collectively referred to as ""kokufu-kabuki and youmono""."
Emperor Kanmu (737–806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shin no Kashira, the mother, is said to be a descendant of the Baekje royal family, descending from King Munjamyeong of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Princess Yasudono (later Emperor Heijō) and Princess Kanno (later Emperor Saga), while Consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Shirakabe, ascended to the throne, Prince Takano Shinkasa was not desired to be appointed as crown prince due to his mother's lowly status as a member of the Immigrant Clan Clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat, serving roles such as chamberlain, head of the university, and middle counselor."
"However, as a result of political strife involving the Fujiwara clan and others, the former Crown Prince and his mother Empress Inoue were suddenly dethroned, and he was appointed Crown Prince on January 2, 773, in the fourth year of the Hoki era."
"In order to avoid the increasing influence of Nara Buddhism temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built instead."
"Once again, a military force was sent to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo under the leadership of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara clan for imposing such military and construction burdens on the peasants."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in the cultural aspect.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought a new movement to Japanese Buddhism under the rule of Emperor Kammu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Hotto, who were both early in their reigns, also had a dark side, with Prince Hayara, who was made crown prince, being exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu and dying in confinement."
"Out of fear of the resentful spirit, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Shōdō posthumously named Prince Sawara as Emperor Shuntennō, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, on the other hand, they have exerted pressure on the so-called ""Six Schools of Nanto"" by confiscating their land and imposing oppression due to the excessive power of existing Buddhism involved in the government."
"It is said that the disorder in the inner palace also led to the later ""Incident at Yōkō-ji,"" becoming a breeding ground for it."
He died on March 17th in the 25th year of Enryaku era (806).
"Emperor Yamato Neto Ama Tsuhiki Iyaderi Mikoto, who was posthumously given a Japanese-style title."
"Along with that, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously named in the style of ancient China."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tengoku Oshihata Miyu Kashiwabara Emperor."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashihara Mausoleum (Kashiwabara Misasagi) in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he was insistent on being buried in Utono, but due to reasons of divination, he was buried in Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"With the advent of the Meiji era, the first Emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in one of the three imperial sanctuaries, the Ko-reiden, located in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, before his birthday, Emperor Akihito made a traditional press conference statement mentioning the joint hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was extensively reported by the South Korean media and became a topic of conversation."
"Some media outlets have reported that the imperial family has Korean roots, with arguments such as the ""theory of the imperial family's Baekje origins."""
"The Otani family (Ootanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsunaga."
"Hino Hirotsunaga was a junior noble in Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was Shinran's daughter who inherited the position of head priest (houshu) of the Jodo Shinshu sect's main temple, Honganji, which represents the majority faction of the sect."
"When surnames became necessary during the Meiji era, the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo) that split in 1602 both took on their positions as their last names."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the fact that the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, was established in the Otani area of Kyoto's Higashiyama Chion-in North Gate."
"Hongan-ji was considered one of the daimyos of the Warring States period in Japan, as it had influence as a force comparable to the daimyos under the spread of the Ikko Ikki. It is common to call the Monshu by the honorary title ""Hongan-ji Kenjo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosuke"", but this is purely for convenience, and it does not mean that the Monshu's family line made Hongan-ji their family name or surname, nor that there was a family called Hongan-ji."
"Kakushin'ni took care of Shinran when he passed away in 1262, and in 1272 he built a hall to enshrine his remains near his own home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Daishi Hall became the Daishi Mausoleum, where followers of Jodo Shinshu gathered to worship Shinran. Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was appointed as the caretaker in his absence."
"However, due to the fact that the Otani Memorial Hall attracted pilgrims and donations from disciples of various provinces, a dispute later arose between the son of Kakuei, Kakunyo, and Kakuei's stepbrother, Yuizen, over the position of head priest. Kakunyo barely emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, and the Daisho Hongan Temple was born."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Honganji Temple and advanced the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation, Kakuraku, during the Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the 7th generation, Sonnyo, the Honganji sect had been formed in Kaga Province, Noto Province, Echizen Province, Omi Province, and other areas."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious community since the death of Shinran, the formation of the community was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a sub-temple of Shorenin, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also acted as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of Honen, who became the 8th head priest, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed, and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the background of the expansion of the teachings led by Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, and the Honganji sect in Kaga drove out the guardian Tomokane clan, leading to the emergence of a situation known as a ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Sengoku period, the Hongan-ji sect, starting from humble farmers, expanded its activities throughout Japan by leveraging its organizational power reaching the samurai class such as local samurai and landowners. However, the Yamashina Hongan-ji temple suffered from war damage in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532. The 10th generation Shonin, having relocated to the Ishiyama Gongobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinarugumura, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), established the Ishiyama Hongan-ji temple."
Ishiyama Honganji was located on the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodogawa River was held by Osaka.
"Using Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his base, Shonin increased his ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, thereby stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Sogen era, followers of the Honganji sect in regions such as Hokuriku began to deviate from the control of Honganji and walk their own path."
"During the time of the 11th successor Kennyo, the Honganji sect, which had virtually become an independent daimyo power, expanded into Kinai and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away the lordship power from religious forces."
"The conflict between Honganji and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw Honganji, fortified in Ishiyama Honganji, teaming up with followers across the country to resist the Oda clan. This collaboration allowed Honganji to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjo-ji in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the uprising that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the water forces of the Mori clan, allied with the Hongan-ji, were defeated by the Oda naval forces in the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Hongan-ji outside its own domain."
"While the Hongan-ji temple continued to gather support from the Iga clan, it maintained its strength. However, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained a decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to retreat from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The temple's power as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, the eldest son Norinaka and Kennyo disagreed over continuing to resist against Kennyo's intentions, and when Kennyo passed away in 1593, his third son Junnyo was chosen as his successor."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple began to split over the position of the gatekeeper, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Kyonyo and Junyo separate temple grounds, leading to the establishment of Higashi Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers from the Kyodan of Junjo, who became Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyonyo of Tokudo, and Honganji split east and west."
"Shinran, the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the heads of the powerful Hino and Saionji families, who are descendants of Hino Hirotane (the father of Kakunyo), have traditionally been adopted as the adopted sons of influential court nobles, and have continued to intermarry with court nobles for generations, leading to a further advancement of their status through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo-tanabe City is located in the central part of the triangle zone of three prefectures, Kyoto Prefecture in the south, and it borders Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"Kizu River flows north to south on the eastern side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while it is sandwiched between the Nara mountains on the western side, and the central area is crossed by the West Japan Railway Katanomachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are characterized as commuter towns."
"On April 1, 1997, the town of Tanabe in Tsukikikun became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Yawata was established for the first time in 20 years, becoming the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District became a city under the name of ""Kyotanabe City"" by adding ""Kyoto"" to it, and on the same day, another city changed its name from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City""."
The new city name was selected through a general public solicitation.
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is thriving, with gyokuro being a specialty product."
A company based in Kyotanabe City.
"Keihan Uji Bus (operating in the eastern part of the city since November 10, 2007)."

Kannonji Temple (Kyotanabe City) A temple where the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon standing statue is enshrined.
The statue of Zen master Ikkyu and the famous garden have been designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Shin-Nabari Station, JR Kyōtanabe Station, and Matsui Yamate Station."
"Kintetsu Nishinakabe Station and JR Kyo-Tanabe Station function as the centers of Kyotanabe City, while Matsui Yamate Station serves as the central station of Keihan Higashi-Rose Town."
Regular subway trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line also stop at Kintetsu Nittaiji Station.
JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the same time the city was incorporated.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line's Nishikusjo Station and Higashikusjo Station.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the use of the old province name of Wakayama, ""Kii,"" in the name of the station in Tanabe City is to avoid duplication of station names within the same West Japan Railway Company region."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyoto Tanabe Office is located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Sales Office is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province (Musashinokuni) was one of the ancient provinces of Japan, which was a local administrative division."
"This corresponds to the area excluding the Sumida River in current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, and the eastern regions and islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (the entire area of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama City)."
"In the Engi era, the social status was determined by the classification of governors and provinces, as well as distant provinces."
Heian-kyo (Heian Capital) is the capital of Japan established by Emperor Kanmu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was constructed in the area that currently corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, in the Katsura District and Atago District of Yamashiro Province, spanning both districts. It was a capital city divided into a rectangular grid measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Established the Imperial Palace at the center of the northern end of the capital, and from there, placed the Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city to divide it into the districts of Rakuchu (left side) and Ukyo (right side, with the east being Rakuchu and the west being Ukyo)."
"The site plan is basically a replica of Heijokyo, following the model of the Sui and Tang dynasties' Chang'an."
"However, there were no city walls."
There is a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Chinese Feng Shui principle of Four Gods corresponding to the directions.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the present-day Kyoto city.
"The main street of the northern limit is Ichijo-dori, located between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
The Southern boundary of Kujo-Oji is Kujo Street slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
The Eastern Limit of Edo's Tokyo Gokumai Road corresponds to the present Teramachi-dori.
"The estimated location of the sunset in Nishikyogoku Oji, in the west of Kyoto, is a line connecting the JR West Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Railway Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station in a north-south direction."
"Inside the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring about 40 jo (approximately 120 meters) on each side, with major and minor roads running north, south, east, and west."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows at the northern border) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
The 16 towns belonging to the same district were each assigned a number.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
"The width of the road was at least four zhang (about 12m) in the alleyways, and more than eight zhang (about 24m) in the main streets."
Many of the existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower than this in most places.
"At the main road of Suzaku, the width was as much as 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"Furthermore, there were parallel rivers flowing in Horikawa Komichi and Nishihorikawa Komichi (Horikawa and Nishihorikawa) in Kyoto."
Emperor Kanmu established the newly built city of Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful aristocrats and temples that had supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu, who were based in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"It is believed that this relocation of the capital was influenced by a series of events starting from the assassination of Fujiwara Tanezane in Nagaokakyo to the removal of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaokakyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the building of the imperial palace (dairi), followed by the construction of the city (marketplace)."
"However, due to the wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), the area of Ukyo did not urbanize even by the 9th century."
"By the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become nominal, some areas had deteriorated to the point where they were even converted to farmland, which was originally prohibited within the capital."
"The aristocratic residential area was established in the left capital, excluding the north of the right capital close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is an official history book compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the Rikkokushi following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
The editors are Fujiwara no Ietsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of the Kōnin era (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Due to the deaths of three people excluding Sotsugu who died without completion, Emperor Junnwa later ordered Kiyohara Natano, Princess Naoyoshi, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakagami Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyoda to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further edicts were issued, commanding Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsuneyori, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikitori to carry out certain tasks."
"Furthermore, they added Furutakaniwa and Yamada Furutsugu, and finally reported the completion on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841)."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only one who was involved in the project spanning three generations of emperors was Fujiwara no Tsugunobu."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this passage describes the reigns of Emperor Kōken, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna during the era of Emperor Kammu."
"Around the beginning of the 15th century, all 40 volumes were compiled, but they were scattered later. Haga Shojiichi's disciple, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family, and it was published for the first time. (There is also a theory of the revised edition of Yanagihara Norimitsu as an alternative theory)."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, and there is a complete absence of the reign of Emperor Junna."
"It is possible to partially reconstruct the text by using excerpts from the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" which is an excerpt version of the histories of the Six National Chronicles, and the ""Ruijū Kokushi,"" which classifies the sections of the Six National Chronicles."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibon"" which collect excerpts from various sources, and based on this, the following Shueisha translation and commentary Japanese historical materials and Kodansha academic bunko have been published."
It is said that the content reflects the opinions of Fujiwara no Yoshi-tsu the most.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the death notices of the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Continuation of Japanese Chronicles"" and is the same as later historical records."
"However, the obituary of this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions. Among the six national histories, it stands out as one that has maintained a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkoku Shi contains more waka poems compared to the historical books before and after.
Sei Shonagon (around the third year of the Koho era (966?) - around the second year of the Manju era (1025?)) was a female writer and poet during the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but this is unconfirmed."
"The daughter of the famous poet Ki no Tomonori (908-990), who was one of the ""Five Poets of the Pear Chamber"" and lived in his later years."
"There is a legend that identifies my mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosenshu"", but this is nothing more than a ridiculous and groundless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"There are women who have become wives to brothers and sisters, the head of the Gagaku (Imperial Court Music) family, a junior official named Dazai, and a court priest named Hanayama-in no Hojo Kaihidesu, as well as Fujiwara Rinō (the siblings of Fujiwara Michitune's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a wife's name that was taken from the surname ""Sei"" of Sei Haru and the position name ""Shonagon"" of her relatives."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory (from ""Makura no Soshi"") that it is ""Nagiko,"" but it is not trustworthy."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and is known for her collection of 42 short poems, ""Kiyoshio Nagonaishu"" (though some versions have 31 poems in circulation)."
"Below, 14 poems are included in the official collection ""Goshūi Wakashū""."
"Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, serving as the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588))."
"The father is the 12th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"The mother is Keijouin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is his half-brother."
"He originally belonged to a Buddhist sect, but when Nobutaka was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Ujisai and other vassals."
He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and ascended to the position of the 15th shogun.
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga, and allied with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to build a coalition against Nobunaga."
"At one point, he cornered Nobunaga, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, in effect leading to the downfall of the Ashikaga shogunate."
"After that, he spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537 as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Since there was a legitimate child to his elder brother, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, he became an adopted child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, in a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofuku-ji Ichijo-in) under the name Kakkei."
"Later, he was promoted to the rank of Gonshonoda at Kofukuji Temple."
"In the Eiroku Incident of 1565, the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiteru, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Sanjo Triad, and others. Even my younger brother, Ashikaga Shunsuke, who was the head priest of Kano-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared turning Kofukuji Temple against them by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the brother of the Shogun and was promised the position of Kofukuji Temple abbot in the future, so they chose to imprison him instead)."
"However, with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Yoshimasa, he managed to escape and on February 17, 1566 in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshitoki."
"In books that record Yoshiteru's life, it is mentioned that he was also referred to as the Warrior Clan Palace."
"When he was forced to leave the capital, he was attacked by night thieves and was also known as ""The Poor General."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Vice Minister of the Left."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to the ""Gonki"" by Yamashina Genkei, it is clear that before this incident, he had already received his appointment in the 11th year of Eiroku (1568) in February, on the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshie, who was a rival to Yoshiaki. It is written that Yoshiaki's envoy appeared at Genkei's residence, who was the envoy of the appointment, to request mediation for his promotion to Junior Fourth Rank, causing confusion."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshizumi first relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshikata and Rokkaku Yoshiharu of Omi province. However, because Yoshiharu secretly conspired with the Sanjo Trio, Yoshizumi fled to the province of Wakasa in August, where his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitsugu, resided."
"However, in the Wakasa Takeda clan, due to struggles over succession and power struggles among senior vassals, they did not have the strength to go up to Kyoto, and in September they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already held the Adachiya Palace, a branch of the Ashikaga shogunate, with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, and had no intention of actively going to the capital with the newly-secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the journey to the capital did not come to fruition."
"The coronation ceremony is being carried out by Yoshikage Asakura. (Note that there is no official records of Yoshitaka having his coming-of-age ceremony performed up to this point, making it unusually late for the time)."
"Eventually, through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, I moved to Mino Province and relied on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku era (1568), he was enthroned by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank and appointed as a Councilor and Left Guard General."
The JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the West Japan Railway Company's Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway for almost the entire route. There is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway in the area. To avoid confusion, it is referred to as ""JR"" due to connections at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and it is assigned as the corporate color itself as it is positioned as the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
"The entire route consists of double tracks in both directions (outer track, inner track)."
"Both J-Through ICOCA and JR East's Suica, JR Tokai's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa can be used at all stations on the JR Kyoto Line."
The Hankai Line operating management system has been introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that connect to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Furthermore, nearly half of the local trains stop at Fukuchiyama Line's Shin-Sanda Station."
"After JRization, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu originating and terminating at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki area originating at Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train to the Sanin region which started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express, began to operate through to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains running on this section increased significantly."
"Haruka (train), which started operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running as regular trains to Kyoto one year later, and the New Osaka to Kyoto route has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Thunderbird express train to the Hokuriku region."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"The downbound ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" limited express trains entering the Hanwa Line from the Osaka Loop Line at Shin-Osaka pass through the freight line from Ibaraki Station (departure track 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita signal station."
"Therefore, it may take slightly longer than the limited express or rapid service running on the outer tracks in the same section, and there may be occasions when two limited express trains enter New Osaka station at the same time depending on the time of day."
"The track alignment is very good along almost the entire line from Kyoto to Osaka, allowing speeds of up to 130km/h on the outer tracks except for some curved sections."
"The inside line is also compatible with speeds of up to 120 km/h, but regular express trains never run on the inside (except for transfer and special trains)."
The express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, in relation to the inbound and outbound operations at Mukoujimachi (Kyoto comprehensive driving center), transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train)"" and ""Tamba (train)""・""Hokukinki (train)"" run on this section."
"The transfer train between Mukoh Town and Osaka of the ""Thunderbird"", ""Raidencho"", and ""Kitaguni"" services will pass through the Hokuhou Freight Line."
"When storing the train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto Integrated Control Center, proceed in the direction of Osaka Station after passing through Tsukamoto Station, enter the North Freight Line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (follow the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
"Shin-Kaisoku runs directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Line Ako, Kamigo, Ako Line Harima Ako direction through JR Kyoto Line to Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From daytime to night, trains run every 15 minutes. During the daytime, one train from Kyoto goes to the Kosei Line, while the remaining three go directly to the Biwako Line."
All four trains run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
Operates with 8 or 12 cars using JR West Japan 223 series train sets 1000 and 2000.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard trunk road approximately 100km long, with its starting point in Kumiyama-cho, Kyoto Prefecture and its endpoint in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"The long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture runs vertically, strengthening collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, promoting regional revitalization, and serving as the southern outer ring road of the vulnerable Kyoto City metropolitan area with high-standard road network."
"The governor of Kyoto Prefecture expresses the highway as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections - the starting point, central section, and ending point - have opened, with the starting point operating under the name of the Kyoshi Bypass instead of the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"Also, it is common for the Kyoto Tamba Road alone to be referred to as the Kyoto Vertical Highway in general."
"The main line section of the Amanohashidate IC on the Miyazu side does not end here, and is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, which is a regional high-standard road."
"In addition, the section between Kugayama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed expressway, so minimum speed limits apply and passage such as small vehicles is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5 meters are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Aya-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Agon Temple IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the toll-free section."
"The Kyo-Tanba Wachiyama IC to Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open around summer to fall of 2008, is planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, so the current free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to become a toll road."
"In accordance with this, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line tollgate (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and the Ayabe Angokoji tollgate will be newly established."
"There is no toll booth at the current Ayabe Ankokuji IC, so there will be no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto line tollgate (Ayabe JCT) is constructed to be close to a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyoto Tanba Wachi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism and is scheduled to open in the 2014 fiscal year, but the management system after the opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Kameoka Road (Kudaikake IC to Kameoka IC) on National Route 9 became a toll road, while the Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) on National Route 9 became a temporarily free road."
"May 6, 1993: Between Tatukake IC and Chiyogawa IC, the route changes from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC started operations as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru Oe IC opens, linking the Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (provisional two lanes for opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: With the privatization of the four highway-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Independent Administrative Agency Japan Highway Public Corporation and Debt Repayment Organization, and management was transferred to the West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections where the background color of the IC number field is marked with ■ indicate that the road is in service.
"In addition, the sections where the background color of the facility name field is ■ indicate that the facility is not in operation, or has not been completed."
The name of the section not yet in service is provisional.

"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with its entire boundary on Mt. Hiei at an elevation of 848m."
"The mountain is more commonly referred to as Mount Hieizan or Hieizan, rather than by the name of the Enryaku-ji Temple."
It was located to the north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai school established by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822).
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the subordinate temples.
"Since the establishment of Saicho, it has been one of the centers of Heian Buddhism along with Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Hokke, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation), and chanting were also practiced, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university, receiving the respect and great power of the imperial family and nobility during the Heian period."
"In particular, the ritual prayers conducted by esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, known as ""Daimitsu,"" competed with the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple in the Shingon sect (Toyimitsu)."
"The term ""Enryaku-ji"" refers to the total of the three towers and sixteen valleys of the temples located in the eastern tower, western tower, and Yokogawa on the foothills of Mt. Hiei, which are scattered around the precincts."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikanin at Mount Hiei, marking the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was granted after taking the era name at the time of its founding, which occurred in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) following the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced many renowned monks, including Ennin and Enchin who laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryogen who founded the Yuzen Nembutsu school, Hōnen who founded the Jodo sect, Shinran who founded the Jodo Shinshu sect, Eisai who founded the Rinzai sect, Dogen who founded the Soto sect, and Nichiren who founded the Nichiren sect. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, earning the temple the nickname ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"Furthermore, intense ascetic practices such as the ""12-year mountain retreat"" and the ""thousand-day pilgrimage"" have been continued to the present day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and registered as a World Cultural Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyamatsumi, the landowner deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's common name is Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyō-Jingo (766) in Shiga-gun, Ōmi Province (now Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture), although some sources suggest he was born in 767."
"At the age of fifteen, in the year 780 (Ten'ō 11), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the temple in Ōmi Province and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), I received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara, becoming a formal monk."
"Due to personal reasons, the young man Masumi did not seek a stable position in a large temple in Nara, but instead devoted himself to training and studying scripture on Mount Hiei near his hometown."
"Saicho considered the teaching of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the various scriptures, and studied the ""Three Great Sections of the Lotus Sutra"" (Exegesis on the Lotus Sutra, Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra, and Mahakashyapa's Contemplation on the ""True Dharma"") written by the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small temple consisting of Yakushi Hall, Manjushri Hall, and a scripture hall at the present location of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was allowed after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"During the time of Emperor Kammu, he relied on Saicho, received support from the Emperor and the influential Wake clan, and gradually, Mount Hiei Temple prospered as a dojo for national defense guarding Kyoto's ""demon gate"" (northeast)."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802 AD), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I sailed to Tang on a mission ship."
"Ennin went to the sacred site of Mt. Hiei and studied Tendai Buddhism and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of the monk Dojui, a disciple of the Tendai master Zhiyi."
"Furthermore, at Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), studying esoteric Buddhism from the monk Shunxiao and Zen from Master Sharen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is commonly believed that the moon is deified and is considered a god who rules over the night, but there are also other theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"In the Nihon Shoki, there is a story of Yasotsuku killing the Hoakusa god. Therefore, although generally considered a male god, there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and there are also many goddesses with aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the goddess theory, stating that the story of the killing of Hosokino-kami cannot be definitively attributed to a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the ""Kojiki,"" it is said that when Izanagi escaped from Yomi and performed a purification ceremony, he gave birth to Tsukuyomi from his right eye, Amaterasu from his other eye, and Susano-o from his nose, forming the three noble children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there are stories that Amaterasu was born from the left eye instead of the right, and that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The domain of her rule is also not fixed, including the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in conjunction with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but the field of comparative mythology points out that similar concepts exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as written in the 'Five Records of Predestined Affinities'), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and the identification of the two came later."
"In addition, in the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation of the heavens and the earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, that is, the sun and the moon, to govern the day and night respectively, and to separate light from darkness, the creation of the sun and moon is narrated."
It is also thought that the births of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were in accordance with the common pattern of sun and moon being born as a pair in worldwide myths of the origin of the sun and moon.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in prominent actions."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" Section Five, Chapter Eleven, that the origin of grains is being discussed."
Some theories suggest that balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationships between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, as well as between Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Umisachi)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some people argue for the theory of the same god because Susano-o's dominion and episodes partly overlap.
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, it is said that she was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and she is known as one of the ""three noble children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukuyomi is commanded to ""inform the night eating country"", but there is no further activity after this."
There is also a theory that there is a country of Yorozu in the night where the god Izanami is.
"In the fifth section of the Age of the Gods in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" it is briefly mentioned that ""a god of the moon, which emits radiance second only to the sun, was born and elevated to the heavens to govern alongside the sun."" In the following section, it is said in a different account that Izanagi-no-Mikoto gave birth to Oho-namuchi-no-Mikoto while holding a white copper mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to Tsuki-yumi-no-Mikoto while holding a white copper mirror in his right hand."
"Regarding the domain of dominion, there are several stories in which it is instructed to rule the heavens alongside the sun goddess Amaterasu. On the other hand, there is also a story of being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast sea (which apparently came from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of three gods are parallel."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu Ōmikami and Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto received an order from Amaterasu to come down from the heavens and meet with the god of sustenance (Uke Mochi), and so Tsukiyomi descended to where the god of sustenance was."
"In response, the god Hojoshin spat out food as an offering, but Tsukuyomi no Mikoto, disgusted, became angry and killed Hojoshin with a sword."
"From the dead body of the god of agriculture, cows, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, and this became the origin of grain."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) refers to a government position that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasa-sho under the Ritsuryo system of ancient Japan."
"The practice of fortune-telling and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which was originally set up as a specific skill (technician) and later expanded beyond the original legal regulations to oversee all forms of divination, magic, and rituals."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official persons who practice fortune-telling, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times it is defined as a type of clergy who perform private prayers and fortune-telling in private."
"It is sometimes pronounced as ""on-yo-ji"" without gemination."
"It is believed that all phenomena are made up of a combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was mostly completed during the Zhou dynasty. This ideology, along with closely related fields such as astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, was introduced to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) by the Asuka period, at the latest by the year 512 when scholars of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje during the reign of Emperor Keitai, or in 554 when a divination scholar arrived during the reign of Emperor Kinmei."
"Although the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was initially minimal, in 602 AD (Emperor Suiko's 10th year), the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, Kangye, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats including Prince Shotoku. This had a significant impact on our country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (the Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin Yang and Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, in 607 AD (the 15th year of Empress Suiko), the dispatch of envoys to the advanced civilization country of Sui began. Additionally, the influence of Yin Yang and Five Elements philosophy became evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap Rank System."
"Afterwards, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the envoy to Sui Dynasty (later Tang Dynasty), and also invited many monks or scholars from China or the Korean Peninsula west coast to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various disciplines progresses, it has become important in Japan to consider the operation and position of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, judge fortunes and misfortunes based on the theory of the generation and restriction of the Five Elements, and predict the future, as well as obtain guidance for various matters, by using this theory to determine auspicious and inauspicious events and establish a code of conduct. Therefore, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory has come to be emphasized as a strategy for judging fortunes and obtaining a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astronomy and the Yin Yang Five Elements philosophy to the extent of taking a divination during the Jinshin Rebellion, established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first astrological observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Onmyo Gogyo philosophy became more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyojo as a department within the Nakatsukasano Naiki of the Ministry of Central Affairs was formalized. This included the appointment of permanent officials such as astronomers, diviners, Onmyoji, calendar scholars, and weather forecaster scholars. Alongside the Kiboku of the Jingikan, they were authorized to officially conduct divination."
"Those responsible for introducing continental technology are experts in their field. In order to master various disciplines and excel in interpreting Chinese texts, scholars and onmyoji are appointed, typically including immigrants knowledgeable in the Han Dynasty, Later Han Dynasty, Sui Dynasty that held hegemony on the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholars from Silla, which initially held power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of Tenji) where Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Baekje dynasty. Many scholars immigrated from Baekje as refugees during this period, and a large number of them were appointed to official positions."
"Originally, the techniques of the Onmyoryo were purely focused on divination, geomancy (similar to feng shui), astronomical observation, astrology, creating calendars, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and managing the lunar calendar. They primarily used theoretical analysis based on the principles of the Five Elements to predict astronomical observations, manage calendars, and judge the auspiciousness of events. They did not engage in religious rituals or sorcery like Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, their role was crucial in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court and in assessing the auspiciousness of locations and directions, particularly during events like relocation of the capital."
The structure of the Onmyoryo as a system of government officials and the duties of Onmyoji.
"In the Onmyo Agency, as an administrative official,"
"Supervising the Yin and Yang Bureau, overseeing all aspects of astronomy, calendars, weather, and natural phenomena, recording and sealing any abnormalities without leaking to the outside, reporting them secretly (Astronomy Confidential Report), presenting the calendar for the new year created by the calendar expert by November 1 every year (Calendar Report), as well as the duty to report the results of divination and the state of the land as needed."
"The official rank is Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade."

I carried out general administrative tasks such as reviewing documents within the dormitory.
I carried out record-keeping tasks such as drafting and reading official documents.
I assisted the head of the Yin and Yang Division in performing record-keeping tasks.
"As an official with skills,"
"An instructor who observes the changes in astronomical phenomena and seals them tightly to prevent any leaks to the outside, as well as oversees ten astronomy students who are in training."
"Among the various paths of Yin and Yang, astronomy was considered the most difficult, so it is set at a higher rank than other doctors."
An instructor who leads 10 students in Yin-Yang 生 practice.
It is set at a high position similar to that of an astronomical doctor in the Seven Rank System.
