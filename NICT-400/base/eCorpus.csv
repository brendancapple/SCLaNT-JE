"The Doshisha is an educational institution, which includes Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts."
"Founded by Joseph Hardy Neesima (Jo NIIJIMA) in 1875, the Doshisha had nine educational institutions as of April 2005, ranging from kindergarten to university, all of which use the name ""Doshisha."" These are Christian institutions that are run based on the principles of Protestantism (Congregationalism)."
"Approximately 36,000 students were studying at the Doshisha as of April 2004."
"At present, Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) rates the Doshisha at <AA+>."
<AA+> is the second-highest rating out of 21 ratings.
"It has the highest rating among the educational institutions, along with Waseda University and Keio University."
"The Doshisha was founded on the sprit of ""conscience,"" based on the spirit of Christianity."
"Joseph Hardy Neesima defined a goal of nurturing ""those who use their abilities as conscience dictates."""
"He wanted to send ""graduates filled with conscience"" into the world by providing an education based on Christian values and thereby fostering well-balanced individuals."
"Some memorial monuments on which his ideal of education has been inscribed in his own handwriting are housed at several educational institutions, such as Doshisha University."
"On these monuments one can see the following words: ""I earnestly desire that many young people filled with conscience will be raised and sent out by our school."""
"Additionally, the Doshisha established the fundamental educational ideals of ""Christian principles,"" ""liberalism"" and ""internationalism"" in order to achieve the education of ""conscience""; through these ideals the Doshisha seeks to send forth those who are ""the nation's conscience."""
"The Doshisha is an educational institution based on Protestantism, and it has a lineage of the Congregational church."
"However, it is different from other Christian universities in that it doesn't seek to preach Christianity as a main goal of education."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era, established the Doshisha English School, which ultimately became the present Doshisha."
"1875: Joseph Hardy Neesima established Doshisha English School at Marutamachi, Teramachi-dori Street, Kyoto Prefecture."
1876: The campus was relocated from Teramachi to Imadegawa.
"1877: In April, Doshisha Bunko Nyokoba was established and in September it was renamed as the Doshisha Girls' School."
1883: The Rules of the School were established.
"1888: ""The Goal in Establishing Doshisha University"" was published in major newspapers and magazines."

"Soujun IKKYUU was a Zen monk in the Daitokuji branch of the Rinzai sect, during the Muromachi period."
He is known as a character in stories.
"For IKKYUU's Witty Sayings refer to the section on ""IKYUU's Sayings"" (also some on this page); for the TV cartoon ""Ikkyuu-san"", refer to the section on ""Ikyuu-san""."
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"In Kazunaga SUGAWARA's diary, ""Higashiboujou Kazunaga Kyouki"", he wrote on August 1st of 1494 that ""it is said in secret that the monk IKKYUU is a prince, the illegitimate child of Gokomatsu."
"Nobody in the world knows this."""
"According to later historical documents, his childhood name was Sengikumaru."
"Called Shuuken for a long time, he also went by Kyouunshi, Katsuro, and Mukei."
"Soujun was his Kaimyo (posthumous Buddhist name), also written as Soujun."
IKKYUU was his Dougou (monk's name).
"(Refer to the section on ""Kaimyo"" for Kaimyo and Dougou.)"
"He took orders under Shuukan SHOUGE at Kyoto's Ankokuji at the age of 6, and was named Shuuken."
"He quickly developed a talent for poetry; and his poems ""Choumonshunsou"", which he wrote at 13, and ""Shunishukka"", which he wrote at 15 years of age, were praised throughout Kyoto."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a student of Soui KENOU and changed his name to Soujun."
"Whether it was because of the death of his teacher is difficult to determine, but IKKYUU attempted suicide around that time."
In 1415 he became a student of high priest Soudon KASOU at Kyoto's Daitokuji.
"He received the name IKKYUU from KASOU when he answered the Koan called Touzan's 3 Blows by saying ""the treacherous path returns to the safe path; take a rest and let the rain fall, let the wind blow."""
"The ""treacherous path"" refers to the world of confusion (distracting thoughts), while the ""safe path"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in 1420 he heard the calling of a crow, and was immediately enlightened."
"KASOU tried to give him a certificate of dharma transmission, but IKKYUU refused it."
It is said that KASOU laughed and called him a fool as he sent him away.
"From then on he lived a crazy life of poetry, writing, and painting."
In 1428 Emperor Shoukou died without leaving behind a son; and Emperor Gohanazono from the Fushiminomiya family was enthroned.
It is said that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement was based on a recommendation from IKKYUU.
"From ""A chronological history of the Priest Ikkyuu of Toukai""."
"Actually, Yoshio IMAIZUMI says that Emperor Gohanazono's enthronement had the support of the shogunate, and had nothing to do with IKKYUU's recommendation."
"After the Onin War in 1474, at the order of Emperor Gotsuchimikado he was installed as chief priest (the 47th) of Daitokuji; and although he did not live in the temple, he put a lot of effort into its restoration."
"Kyoto Gosho is an imperial palace located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Since the Emperor's visit to Tokyo in Meiji Restoration, the Emperor has resided in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (the former Edo-jo Castle) and thus the Kyoto Gosho has been preserved since 1877."
"Since the Meiji period, the Kyoto Gosho has also been called Kyoto Kogu."
"Originally, the official imperial palace in Heiankyo was Dairi, situated nearby the center of Heiankyo, but after being devastated by wars, the imperial palace was moved to Satodairi (a temporary palace)."
"Tsuchimikado-Higashinotoin Dairi, one of the temporary palaces, was the imperial palace in which successive imperial families of Jimyoin-to, later called North Imperial Court, resided."
"The imperial palace for imperial families of Daikakuji-to, later called South Imperial Court, was Nijo-Tominokoji Dairi."
"The current Kyoto Gosho is not the original Tsuchimikado-Higashinotoin Dairi itself, but was expanded based on it."
The Kyoto Gosho is usually open to the visitors by application and to the public in Spring and Fall.
The Kyoto Gosho was a residence and an office for the successive Emperors until the Emperor's visit to Tokyo in 1869.
"The existing (the 21st century) Kyoto Gosho is a national property and classified as ""Properties for Imperial Household Use"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Gosho lie Kyoto Omiya Gosho and Sento Gosho, and to the north, across Imadegawa-dori lie Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both Imadegawa Campus)."
"Today, the Kyoto Gosho, the Kyoto Omiya Gosho, and the Sento Gosho are maintained by the Imperial Household Agency, and Kyoto Gyoen, which is the national park around the imperial palaces, is maintained by the Ministry of Environment."
"Usually, the citizens of Kyoto refer to the Kyoto Gosho including the Kyoto Gyoen simply as ""Gosho."""
"Unlike castles in foreign countries, walls surrounding the Gosho are not very high, which is viewed as the difference in how the people of the East and the West feel toward their rulers (Imperial Family and the Emperor)."
"This consideration is based on the example of the French Revolution in which the crowd broke into the Palace of Versailles, which was the palace of the ruler (king), whereas such an event has not occurred in Japan."
"The original Dairi (the imperial palace) in Heiankyo was located to the west of and far from the current Kyoto Gosho, at the northeast of the intersection at Senbon Maruta-machi nearby the Nijo Station of West Japan Railway Company."
"The existing Kyoto Gosho was originally one of the temporary palaces and called Tsuchimikado-Higashinotoin Dono, which was initially used by the Emperor Kogon of the North Imperial Court (Japan) in 1331."
"During the Edo period, the Dairi was reconstructed eight times (six of them were caused by destruction by fire), and the existing building is called Ansei Dairi, which was reconstructed in accordance with the Heian style in 1855."
"Emperor Meiji, who had been living in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for nearly ten years after his visit to Tokyo, visited Kyoto in 1877 and regretted to find the Kyoto Gosho being devastated; he ordered the preservation of the Kyoto Gosho to maintain its original scenery."
"The main buildings in Kyoto Gosho inclulde Shishinden (Ceremonial Hall), Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and Kogo Goten."
"For generations, Ceremonies of Enthronement were held at Shishinden in Kyoto Gosho, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo in Meiji Restoration, under the former Imperial House Code as established in 1889 it was prescribed that the Ceremonies of Enthronement and Daijosai (the Great Thanksgiving Festival) should be held in Kyoto, thereby having the Ceremonies of Enthronement of the Emperor Taisho and the Emperor Showa in the Kyoto Gosho."
"The present Imperial House Code as established after the World War II does not prescribe the place (e.g., Kyoto) for Ceremonies of Enthronement, and in 1990 for the first time in history, the Ceremony of Enthronement of the current Emperor was held at Seiden in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"Takamikura, a formal imperial chamber used at the enthronement ceremony in which an Emperor seats himself to symbolically represent his Imperial Throne, is located in Shishinden in Kyoto Gosho, and thus, at the time of the Ceremony of Enthronement ""Seiden no Gi"" for the current Emperor (corresponding to ""Shishinden no Gi"") the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
The Gate is made of unpainted natural wood with a Kiritsuma zukuri style and Hiwadabuki style roof and is supported by four pillars that are 1.82 meters apart.
The Gate is opened only for special events such as welcoming of the Emperor and foreign dignitaries as well as on the limited days for public viewing.
"Tsuiji-bei Walls on the left and right sides have five lines (horizontal lines), which represent the highest status as a wall."
"Past this Gate is the Jomei-mon Gate with a Ninuri kawara roof, leading to Shishinden on the front."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional forms of music in Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula and Vietnam."
"The Japanese Gagaku (an important intangible cultural heritage) passed down in the Gakubu Section, Shikibu-shoku Department, of the Imperial Household Agency, is mainly described here as follows:"
"The original meaning of Gagaku is 'Gasei-no-Gakubu,' and its antonym is 'Zokugaku (worldly music).'"
"The Gakubu Section, Shikibu-shoku Department of the Imperial Household Agency, defines it as the numbers played by the Gakubu Section, Shikibu-shoku Department of the Imperial Household Agency (except for Western music)."
Most consist of instrumental music that has been inherited as court music.
It is the world's oldest extant style of traditional music played in a large-scale ensemble.
"However, the original ensemble form of Gagaku was discontinued for more than 100 years until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of the musicians (Raku families) and rebuilt it after the turmoil of the Onin War, and it is doubtful how faithfully the style from the Heian period has been inherited."
"The features of pronunciation of the Japanese language before the sixteenth century are passed on without change: the line of Ha is pronounced as fa, fi, fu, fe, fo, when singing the musical score of the Hichiriki instrument written in katakana as Shoga, for example by chanting the letters of the musical note to recite the melody, which implies that the whole style can be quite faithfully recreated."
"The musical score written in Chinese characters, such as that of the Gakubiwa instrument, has many similarities to a biwa musical score discovered in Dun Huang, China, and several older forms introduced from the Asian continent have been inherited."
"As the most important historical data, ""Taigen-sho,"" written by TOYOHARA no Muneaki (1450-1512), which expresses concern about the dissipation of the records of Gagaku and others due to the turmoil of the Onin War, can be cited."
"This is a valuable record of Gagaku in the old days, in which Muneaki from a Raku family of Sho flute compiled the records of Gagaku, mainly about the Sho flute and Bugaku (gagaku piece with dance)."
"It is based on the ceremonial music introduced from China, the Korean Peninsula and South Asia prior to the tenth century."
"In China, Gagaku (ya-y?e) meant the music played in ceremonies."
"Togaku music, however, which is said to have been introduced from China and is presently played as Japanese Gagaku, is believed to be based on the music played in the Tang period at a party called the Engaku."
"As for the categories of numbers, international names including Togaku, Komagaku and Rinyugaku (music of Champa) have been brought over, and the elements of Japanese ancient music before the introduction of the music from the continent were included."
"Before the modern age, the Tennoji gakuso Theater in Shitenno-ji Temple (Osaka City) with the oldest style, the Ouchi gakuso Theater in the Imperial Court (Kyoto) and the Nanto gakuso Theater in Kasugataisha Shrine (Nara City) were called Sanpo gakuso theaters."
"These gakuso theater companies were called to Tokyo during the modern age and became the basis for the current Gakubu section of the Imperial Household Agency, but the tradition of each gakuso theater company has continued in each place."
"Moreover, it has mutually affected Minyo and Shomyo, and the Japanese original style has been created."
"Presently, about 100 numbers are inherited in the Gakubu section, Shikibu-shoku Department, of the Imperial Household Agency."
"For the lyrics, see the section on Kuniburi-no-utamai dance."
Introduced numbers from abroad (there is an opinion that they should be taken only as Gagaku)
"Sahomai dance and Togaku music, from China, Tenjiku (India), Rinyu (South Vietnam)"
Uhomai dance and Komagaku music from Korea and Bokkai (northeastern region of China)
These include the numbers created in Japan (Japanese music) imitating the above tunes.
Songs made during the Heian period (Utaimono)
See the section on Utaimono for the lyrics.
*Kuniburi-no-utamai dance and Utaimono may be generically called ancient songs.
"Emperor Kammu (737 - April 3, 806) was the 50th Japanese Emperor."
Emperor Kammu was born in 737 as the first prince of Shirakabe no Okimi (later called Emperor Konin).
"According to the Shoku-Nihongi (the second in a series of chronicles about Japan), his mother, TAKANO no Nigasa, was a descendant of the Baekje Royal Family, whose ancestors were the Baekje Muryeong-wang."
"The mother of Ate (who would later become Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (or Kaminu, who would later become Emperor Saga) was FUJIWARA no Otomuro, and the mother of Otomo (who would later become Emperor Junna) was FUJIWARA no Tabiko."
"Due to the mother's humble background of the naturalized clansmen Yamatouji, there was no hope for the Emperor to become a crown prince even after his father, Shirakabe no Okimi's enthronement; but he aimed to succeed as a government bureaucrat and held the position like a palace staff person (jiju), the manager of Daigaku (Daigaku no Kami) and Nakatsukasakyo."
"However, Imperial Prince Osabe, the former crown prince and his half brother with the same father, and his mother, Imperial Princess Inoe, were gotten rid of due to the political fight, and the Emperor Kammu had a ceremony of the formal investiture of the Crown Prince on February 2, 773."
TheHeijo-Kyo capital was relocated to the province of Yamashiro in order to prevent the Nara Buddhist temples from having too much political power.
"First, Nagaoka-kyo was built in 784, and Heian-kyo was rebuilt in 794."
"The troops of SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro, being Seii Taishogun (great general who subdues the barbarians) were sent to the Tohoku area to defeat Ezo (Emishi)."
"However, in Emperor Kammu's last years, FUJIWARA no Otsugu of the the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan criticized the Emperor for undertaking this kind of military action and said that the policy subjected farmers to great hardship."
"In the cultural aspect it is said that the Emperor suggested the editing of ""Shoku-Nihongi (The Chronicles of Japan II)."""
It was during Emperor Kammu's administration that Saicho and Kukai came back from Tang and had new influence on the Japanese Buddhist culture.
"There is a sad aspect that Imperial Princess Inoe and Imperial Prince Osabe had an unnatural death, or that his brother, Imperial Prince Sawara, who was the first prince when the Kammu government started, was accused of assassinating FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu; he was sentenced to deportation in 785 and died."
"As the Emperor was concerned about a grudge, he gave a tsuigo, Emperor Sudo, to Imperial Prince Sawara on August 16, 800, renamed Imperial Princess Inoe's mausoleum as Misasagi and recouped the lack of an Empress."
"While the Emperor is known as a guardian of Saicho and Kukai, the existing Buddhism had too much relation to (and power in) politics; Nanto Rokushu (Rikushu) (The Six Sects of the Southern Capital) were forced to lose their official rank or their rewards."
"There was no strict morals in the palace, and this caused the emergence of hotbeds such as ""the Kusuko Incident."""
"The Emperor died on April 13, 806."
The Emperor was posthumously given the Japanese name Yamatoneko amatsu hitsugiiyaderi.
He was also posthumously given the Hun-style name Emperor Kammu.
He was also known as Emperor Kashiwabara and Amekunioshiharukiamenoshitashiroshimesu.
"The Imperial Mausoleum is known as Kashiwabara no Misasagi, located in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Emperor Kammu expressed a strong desire to be buried in Utano when he died; however, on the advice of a fortune teller, he was buried in Kashiwabara no Misasagi, which is located in Fushimi."
He was enshrined at Heian-jingu Shrine during the Meiji period as the first Emperor of Heian-kyo.
All the past Emperors are enshrined in Kyuchu-sanden (Three Shrines of the Imperial Court).
"On December 18, 2001, Akihito mentioned in the annual interview before his birthday, for the comment of mutual relief on the FIFA World Cup of Soccer in the following year, ""I feel a certain kinship with Korea after knowing Emperor Kammu's mother's descendant is related to Baekje Muryeong-wang, according to Shoku-Nihongi (The Chronicles of Japan II)."""
"This comment was a popular topic in Korean mass media, although it was not a significant issue in Japan."
From a certain news report there was an exaggerated comment stating that the Royal Family is descended from ethnic Koreans or that the Royal Family's origin started from Paekche and so on.
"Otanike (Otani family) is the yago (literally, the ""house name"") of the descendants of Kakue, a son of Hirotsuna HINO and Kakushin-ni."
"Hirotsuna HINO was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, the hereditary monshu (head of a Buddhist sect) and honshu (chief priest) of the Hongan-ji Temple (the largest school of the Jodo Shinshu sect of Buddhism)."
"Subsequent to the establishment of the Myojihissho system (which required people to adopt surnames) in the Meiji period, the kancho of the Honganji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect (Nishi Hongan-ji Temple) and the kancho of the Otani school of the Shinshu sect (Shunshu-honbyo Mausoleum), which was established when the Hongan-ji was split in two in 1602, both adopted Otani as their surname."
"The Otani surname comes from the fact that the Byodo Mausoleum of Shinran (as mentioned below) was settled on the land of Otani of Kitamon, the north gate of Chionin in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Interestingly, Hongan-ji Temple is counted among the warlords because it gained power equivalent to that of a warlord with the expansion of Ikko-ikki during the Sengoku period (Japan), and sometimes ""Kennyo HONGANJI"" or ""Kosa HONGANJI"" is used for Homyo (the Jodo Shinshu sect) of the monshu (chief priest) or for Imina with ""Honganji"" being prefixed; however, it is used simply for the convenience of naming, as the family line of the monshu, the chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple, never used Honganji as a last name or surname and there was no clan called Honganji."
"Kakushin-ni was by Shinran's bedside when he died in 1262; and in 1272 he built Do, a temple building, to house his remains in Otani near Shinran's house in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"The Do temple building became Otani-byodo Mausoleum, a site respected and worshiped by followers of the Jodo Shinshu sect as the Mausoleum of Shinran, which led to its administration as a position of caretaker by Kakue, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni."
"However, because Otani-byodo Mausoleum drew pilgrimages and donations from various provinces, Kakue's child Kakunyo and Kakue's younger brother by a different father, Yuizen, started to fight for the position of caretaker; resulting in the narrow victory of Kakunyo, and therefore Kakunyo established the hereditary position of caretaker based on Kakunyo's family blood."
"In 1312 Kakunyo made the mausoleum a temple, whereby Otani Honganji Temple was born."
"Thereafter, Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, proceeded to the formation of the Honganji Buddhist sect, the influence of which expanded to the Hokuriku region via the fifth generation (Shakunyo) and the seventh generation (Zonnyo); the Honganji Buddhist sect was formed in Kaga-no-kuni, Noto-no-kuni, Echizen-no-kuni, Omi-no-kuni, and so on."
"However, the Honganji Buddhist sect was founded much later than the Buddhist sects founded by other schools of the Jodo Shinshu sect following Shinran's death, and Hongan-ji Temple was still considered a branch temple of Shorenin at the beginning of the Muromachi period; it is said that because of their ties with the Hino family (Shinran's family), the Otani Family performed similar management duties to those performed by the Kujo Family."
"Early in the latter half of the fifteenth century, the Honganji Buddhist sect expanded across Japan through the activities of Rennyo, who became the eighth-generation monshu (chief priest); however, in 1465 the monshu was expelled from Otani Honganji Temple and moved to Yoshizaki, in Echizen, then to the Yamashina ward in the suburbs of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the power expansion of the Honganji Buddhist sect in the generation of Rennyo, Kaga Ikko-ikki occurred in 1488 and the Honganji Buddhist sect in Kaga expelled the Shugo Togashi clan, with the result that Kaga was called ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For about 100 years up to 1580, Kaga had been a country where the Ikkoshu sect ruled."
"Following the dawn of the sixteenth century, amid the turmoil of Sengoku, the Honganji Buddhist sect engaged its activities in various regions in Japan using its power of organization, which was constituted by petty peasants up to samurai hierarchy such as the local samurai, the local ruling families and so on; however, in 1532 Yamashina Honganji Temple suffered damage due to the Tenbun-hokke-no-ran War, and therefore the tenth generation (Shonyo) moved to Ishiyama Gobo, which was opened in Nishinari-gun, Settsu-no-kuni (currently Osaka City) by Rennyo, which became Ishiyama Honganji Temple."
Located at the highest point of the northern end of the Uemachi plateau was the Ishimaya Honganji Temple.
"The temple overlooked Osaka, a key junction for fluvial traffic at the mouth of the Yoda-gawa River."
"Shonto promoted closer ties with feudal lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court so as to stabilize the power base of the Hongan-ji Temple."
"On the other hand, from the end of Shonyo's period the Honganji Buddhist sect in regions like Hokuriku started to become something of a maverick, escaping from the control of Hongan-ji Temple."
"At the period of the eleventh generation, Kennyo, who was a child of Shonyo, the Honganji Buddhist sect that became a virtually independent feudal lordship, expanded its influence into Kinai, which led to the confrontation with Nobunaga ODA, who tried to establish unified control by seizing seigniory from the religious power."
"The conflict between Hongan-ji Temple and the Oda clan, which began in 1570 and lasted over ten years as the so-called Ishiyama War, burdened Nobunaga heavily, since Hongan-ji Temple had gained the upper hand through the coalition between Kennyo and others who had entrenched themselves in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and Hongan-ji Temple followers who carried on a resistance movement against the Oda clan in various regions."
"However, in 1574 Gansho-ji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise-no-kuni (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan and the resistance movements in various regions settled as Ikko-ikki, which recovered Echizen from the Oda clan, were destroyed in 1575; and the navy of the Mori clan, which was allied with Hongan-ji Temple in Kizugawa-no kassen, was defeated by the navy of the Oda clan in 1578, assuming the defeat of Hongan-ji Temple in various places other than the premises of Hongan-ji Temple."
"Hongan-ji Temple retained its predominance by gaining support from Saikashu, but gradually it was isolated in the midst of enemies, ultimately succumbing to Nobunaga, who withdrew imperial command from the Emperor Ogimachi and left Ishiyama Honganji Temple in 1580, whereby Hongan-ji Temple as seigniory was extinguished."
"At that time Kyonyo, who was the eldest child of Kennyo and insisted on continuing the resistance despite the intentions of Kennyo, had a falling out with Kennyo, and when Kennyo died in 1593, the third son Junnyo was welcomed as the successor."
"This incident was the starting point of the path of schism over the position of the monshu (chief priest) of Hongan-ji Temple, and in 1602 Ieyasu TOKUGAWA split Hongan-ji Temple by giving Kyonyo a temple and land for Higashi Hongan-ji Temple, which was thus separated from Junnyo's Honganji Buddhist Sect."
"At this point numerous followers moved from Junnyo's Buddhist sect, which became Nishi (West) Hongan-ji Temple, to Kyonyo's Higashi Hongan-ji Temple, whereby Hongan-ji Temple was split into eastern and western factions."
"There was a custom developed over generations that both the eastern and western family heads of the Otani Family's having lineage from Shinran, who was a son of the court noble Arinori HINO, and Hirotsuna HINO (Kakunyo's father) were adopted by influential court nobles; consequently, both the Otani families have increasingly been related to court nobles considering the maternal line, since they kept marriages with court nobles over generations."
"Kyoutanabe City is a city in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, located near the border with Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture."
"Kyoutanabe is in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture near the cities of Yawata and Jouyou, and the towns of Tsuzuki-gun Ide and Souraku-gun Seika, as well as Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture; it is located at the intersection of three prefectures."
"The city is in between the Kizu River to the east, which runs north-south, and the Ikoma mountains to the west; and the West Japan Railway Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line run through the middle of the city."
"It is a characteristic bedroom community for the cities of Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka."
April 1 1997 - The City was formed from Tsuzuki -gun Tanabe Chou (Town).
"It became the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years after Yawata City, and the 669th City nationwide."
"Kyoto Tsuzuki-gun Tanabe Chou (Town) was made a city by the name of Kyoto Tanabe City, in order to avoid confusion with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, and then had its name changed to Kyoto Kyoutanabe City (it was added ""Kyo""of Kyoto) the same day."
The city name was chosen from submissions from the public.
"Tea (Ujicha) cultivation is thriving, with Gyokuro as a specialty."

"The city's best known stations are Kintetsu Shintanabe Station, JR Kyoutanabe Station, and Matsui Yamate Station."
"Kintetsu Shintanabe and JR Kyoutanabe Stations function as the center of Kyoutanabe City's downtown, while Matsui Yamate Station is at the heart of Keihan East Rose Town."
Regular trains on the Kyoto Subway Karasuma Line also stop at the Kintetsu Shintanabe Station.
"JR Kyoutanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station, but was changed at around the same time as the city was incorporated."
This is the same as in the case of Nishimukou and Higashimukou Stations on the Hankyuu Kyoto Main Line.
"(In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a Kiitanabe Station (Kisei Main Line); it is possible that the addition of 'Kii', the old name for the Wakayama area, to the name of the station was a decision by the administration of the West Japan Railway to avoid duplicate station names.)"

"Musashi Province was one of the provinces administered by the Ryo-sei, or administrative codes."
"The province was equal in size to the combined areas of present-day Saitama Prefecture, the part of Tokyo east of the Sumida River (excluding Shimakyo), and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama City)."
"Its status under the Engishiki (a book of laws and regulation compiled during the Engi era) was Engoku, meaning distant province, in the Kokushi-Kokutokyu-kubun (classification of provinces according to their political and economic situation) category."
"Heian-kyo (literally ""tranquility and peace capital"") was the old capital of Japan established by Emperor Kanmu in 794."
"Heian-kyo was the castle city laid out to be rectangular, of 4.5 km east-west by 2.2 km north-south, built straddling Kadono-no-koori and Otagi-no-koori counties of Yamashiro Province (currently center of Kyoto city, Kyoto Prefecture)."
"The Daidairi (the greater imperial palace) occupied the northernmost central position, and the Suzaku-oji Avenue (main avenue of Heian-kyo) was laid out from there to the center of the city, so as to bisect into Sakyo (left city) and Ukyo (right city) (Sakyo is on the east side and Ukyo is on the west side)."
This two dimensional plan was basically adopted from the Heijo-kyo and copied the Changan of Chinese Sui/Tang dynasties.
"There were, however, no fortified walls."
It is also said that selection of the location followed beliefs of the Shijinsoo (an ideal topography for the four Taoist gods) of Feng Shui (Chinese geomancy) as learned from China.
The ambit of Heian-kyo was smaller than current Kyoto-city.
Ichijo-oji Avenue as the northern limit of the city is the current Ichijo-dori Street between Imadegawa-dori Street and Marutamachi-dori Street.
Kujo-oji Avenue as the southern limit is the current Kujo-dori Street located a little south of JR Kyoto station.
Togoku-oji Avenue as the eastern border is the current Teramachi-dori Street.
"The assumed location for the western border, Nishikyogoku-oji Avenue draws a line north-south between the following two stations - Hanazono Station of the JR West Sanin main line (Kyoto pref.) and Nishi-Kyogoku Station of the Hankyu Kyoto main line."
The inner capital was subdivided into 'Machi/Cho' (town) of approx. 120 sq. meter by Oji (main avenue) and Koji (small alley) which ran east-west and north-south.
"Machi (Cho) of four rows running east-west (except for the northern two rows) were called 'Jo,' and Machi of four rows running north-south were called 'Bo.'"
Each of the sixteen Machi (Cho) belonging to the same Jo and Bo were numbered accordingly.
"According to this rule, a town could be called 'Ukyo 5-Jo 3-Bo 14-Cho.'"
"The width of a road was approx. 12 m, even for Koji (small alleys). Oji (main avenues) were over 24 m."
"Currently, most roads within Kyoto City are much narrower."
Suzaku-oji Avenue had a width of approximately 84 meters.
"Also, Horikawa-koji Alley and Nishi Horikawa-koji Alley ran parallel to rivers (Horikawa River - Kyoto Pref) and Nishihorikawa River)."
"In 784, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to Yamashiro Province and built Nagaoka-Kyo."
"Apparently, it was to get away from Yamato Province where the nobles and Buddhists who supported the Emperor Tenmu government had gathered, and to build the capital for the new Emperor Tenchi."
"However, in 794, only 10 years after that, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the north of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This re-relocation was said to have been caused by a sequence of events, from the assassination of FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu which occurred in Nagaoka-Kyo, to the disinheritance of Imperial Prince Sawara, which also delayed the building of Nagaoka-Kyo and as a result it did not make much progress."
"The building of Heian-kyo is presumed to have started from the greater imperial palace (Daidairi), and then continued to the Kyo (urban district)."
"However, the land of Ukyo did not become developed for dwellings even during the 9th century, due to it being a wetland formed by the Katsura-gawa River (of the Yodo-gawa river system)."
"In the 10th century when the Ritsuryo system became a mere façade, the land was desolated and some areas were diverted to farm lands which was, in general, prohibited in Kyo."
"Residential areas for nobles were established mainly in Sakyo, excepting the northern Ukyo which was close to Daidairi."
"Nihonkoki History Book is a collection of histories created by imperial command; it was compiled in the early Heian period after Shoku-Nihongi (Continuation of Chronicles of Japan), being the third volume of Rikkokushi (Six National Histories)."
"Completed in 840, it contains records of events that occurred over a period of 42 years, from 792 to 833."
FUJIWARA no Otsugu and others compiled it.
"According to the preface, in 819 Emperor Saga ordered FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu, FUJIWARA no Otsugu, FUJIWARA no Sadatsugu and YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo to compile the history book."
"Because all of them except Otsugu died before the work could be completed, Emperor Junna ordered KIYOHARA no Natsuno, Naoyo-o, FUJIWARA no Yoshino, ONO no Minemori, SAKANOUE no Imatsugu and SHIMADA no Kiyota to continue the project."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, more people such as FUJIWARA no Otsugu, MINAMOTO no Tokiwa, FUJIWARA no Yoshino, FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa and ASANO no Katori were called to carry out the work."
"Subsequently, FURU no Takaniwa and YAMATA no Furutsugu joined the compilation, and at last the book was completed on January 5, 841."
"It took 21 years to compile the book, but only FUJIWARA no Otsugu had been involved in the whole project over the three generations of emperors."
"Following ""Shoku-Nihongi,"" the book contains records of the reigns of emperors Kanmu, Heizei, Saga and Junna."
"Until about the early fifteenth century, all 40 volumes of Nihonkoki History Book were in existence, but eventually certain volumes were dispersed and lost; however, Yukinori INAYAMA, one of the disciples of Hokinoichi HANAWA, found 10 volumes of the manuscript at the residence of the Sanjonishi family and published them for the first time (There is an opposing view that the published volumes were based on Norimitsu/Motomitsu YANAGIHARA's recension.)."
"The 10 existing volumes are numbers 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heizei), 20, 21, 22 and 24 (Saga); all the volumes about Emperor Junna are missing."
"It is to some extent possible to restore the text by gathering quotations from ""Nihongi ryaku (The Abbreviated History of Japan),"" extracts from Rikkokushi and ""Ruiju kokushi (History Book),"" a categorized Rikkokushi."
"""Nihon isshi History Book"" and ""Unknown or Lost Writings of the Nihonkoki History Book"" are the collections of the lost texts of Nihonkoki History Book, and with them as a basis the following books were published: ""Japanese Historical Records Commentary,"" from Shueisha Inc., and ""Academic Paperback Library,"" from Kodansha Ltd."
It is said that the contents of the book generally reflected the opinions of FUJIWARA no Otsugu.
"As was the case with ""Shoku-Nihongi,"" short biographies called koden were added to the obituaries of the emperors and retainers of the Imperial Court, which was the same approach seen in the subsequent history books."
"However, the koden in this book was neither mere praise nor criticism, but was instead full of interesting descriptions interwoven with unique comments and impressions, and because of its critical spirit the book was unusual among Rikkokushi."
"Also, it is known that compared with the volumes compiled before and after the book, it contained more Waka/Yamatouta poems than the other volumes of Rikkokushi."
Sei Shonagon (966? - 1025?) was a female writer and poet in the Heian period.
"There is a conjecture that her real name was KIYOHARA no Nagiko, but that remains uncertain."
"She was born when her father KIYOHARA no Motosuke (908 - 990), a noted waka poet and one of the 'Nashitsubo no Gonin (editors of the Gosenshu),' was in his later years."
"Tradition has it that her mother was 'Higaki no Ona,' whose poem was in ""Gosenwakashu (Later Collection of Japanese Poetry),"" but this is utter nonsense."
"Her great-grandfather (or grandfather) was KIYOHARA no Fukayabu, a leading poet in Kokinwakashu (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry)."
"She had brothers called Utanokami Tamenari, Dazai no Shokan (Dazaifu's post) Munenobu, and Kazanin Denjohoshi (palace priest of Kazanin) Kaishu, and she also had a sister who was to be a wife of FUJIWARA no Masato (the brother of FUJIWARA no Michitsuna's mother)."
"It is said that 'Sei Shonagon' denotes her as a lady of the court and that 'Sei' refers to her family name of KIYOHARA, while 'Shonagon' is the name of her relative's bureaucratic post."
"Her real name is unknown, but 'Nagiko' seems to have been her name (""Makura no Soshisho""), although it is not certain."
"She was one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets, and her 42 poems were collected in ""Collection of Sei Shonagon"" (the number of collected poems depends on the ihon (alternative version) (for example, the rufubon (type of manuscript) contains 31 poems)."
"14 of her poems, such as ""Goshui Wakashu"" (Later Collection of Gleanings), were included in the collection of poems by Imperial command."
"Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA was the 15th Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, and its last Shogun (Reigned from 1568 to 1588)."
"His father was Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA, the 12th Shogun of Muromachi Shogunate."
His mother was a daughter of Hisamichi KONOE (Keijuin).
"Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA, the 13th Shogun, was his elder brother from the same mother."
"Although he was a priest when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Hisahide MATSUNAGA and others, he escaped from Kyoto, helped by Shogunate men such as Yusai HOSOKAWA."
"After that, he returned to Kyoto under protection of Nobunaga ODA of Mino Province."
Later he was opposed to Nobunaga and built made siege with Shingen TAKEDA and Yoshikage ASAKURA.
"He was able to get Nobunaga into a corner once, but later he was exiled from Kyoto by Nobunaga; this was the de facto end of Muromachi Shogunate."
"After that, he spent the rest of his life under patronage of Terumoto MORI, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and so on."
"He was born as the second son of Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA, the 12th Shogun, on November 13, 1537."
"Because he had an elder brother, who was heir to the Shogun, he became an adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Naomichi KONOE, in childhood and became a Buddhist priest named Kakukei at Kofuku-ji Ichijoin."
Later he was promoted to Gon no Shozozu of Kofuku-ji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of 1565 his elder brother Yoshiteru, the 13th Shogun, was assassinated by Hisahide MATSUNAGA, Miyoshi Sanninshu and others, and his younger brother Shuko ASHIKAGA, a head of Rokuon'in was also killed."
At this time Yoshiaki was also arrested by Hisahide MATSUNAGA and confined at Kofuku-ji Temple (it is said that Hisahide did not kill Kakukei because he was afraid of having Kofuku-ji Temple for an enemy; Kakukei was Shogun's brother and promised to be Betto (director) of Kofuku-ji Temple in future).
"But Yoshiaki was able to escape from Kyoto, helped by Yusai HOSOKAWA, Koremasa WADA and others, on February 17, 1566, and returned to secular life."
A Book about Yoshiaki records that he was called Buke Gosho as another name.
When he escaped from Kyoto he was attacked by a robber and was called 'a poor Kubo (a court noble)' as well.
"On April 21 he got the official governmental position of Junior 5th Rank, Samano kami."
"There is some doubt about when he attaining governmental position, but it is obvious that he got it at least before February 1568; according to 'Tokitsugu kyoki' written by Tokitsugu YAMASHINA, Tokitsugu was confused when a messenger from Yoshiaki asked him to mediate recommendation of promotion to Juyon'i-ge on the same day Yoshihide ASHIKAGA, who was Yoshiaki's rival, was ordered to become Shogun."
"After an escape from Kyoto, Yoshiaki relied on Yoshitaka ROKKAKU and Yoshiharu ROKKAKU of Omi Province, but Yoshiharu's secret contact with Miyoshi-Sanninshu made him flee to Yoshizumi TAKEDA of Wakasa Province on August."
"But the Wakasa TAKEDA clan did not have enough power to go up to Kyoto because of troubles over inheritance, conflicts between elder statesmen and so on, so Yoshiaki fled to Yoshikage ASAKURA of Echizen Province in September and asked him to help restore the Shogunate."
"But Yoshikage ASAKURA had already patronized 'Kuratani gosho' Tsugutomo ASHIKAGA, a relative of the ASHIKAGA Shogunate, and was not eager to go up to Kyoto with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA, who had just returned to secular life; so Yoshiaki could not return to Kyoto."
The person who performed the ceremony was Yoshikage ASAKURA (there is no record which shows Yoshiaki had a coming-of -age ceremony officially until this time; it could be said that it was too late in this era).
"Later, through Mitsuhide AKECHI, who was an elder statesman of ASAKURA, as an intermediary Yoshiaki relied on Nobunaga ODA and moved to Mino Province."
"He went up to Kyoto, helped by Nobunaga ODA on September, 1568."
On October 18 he became the 15th Shogun by an order from the Imperial Court.
At the same time he was promoted to Junior 4th Rank and got governmental positions of Sangi and Sakonoe Gonchujo.
JR Kyoto-sen (JR Kyoto Line) is the unofficial name given to the section of the Tokaido Main Line of the West Japan Railway (JR West) that runs between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This name has been used since March 13, 1988."
"The prefix ""JR"" had to be added to ""Kyoto Line"" in this unofficial name to prevent confusion as this line connects with the Hankyu Kyoto Line, operated by the Hankyu Corporation (nearly all of which runs in parallel with the JR Kyoto Line), at Osaka (Umeda) Station and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, operated by the Kintetsu Corporation, at Kyoto Station."
"Together with the JR Kobe Line, this line is considered to be one of the company's main lines so it is color-coded in blue, which is the company's corporate color."
"The line runs on the right bank of the Yodo-gawa River in parallel with the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Hankyu Kyoto Line, and the special rapid connects the distance of 42.8 km between Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes in the shortest time (at a maximum speed of 130 km/h)."
The entire section has a quadruple track in each direction (outer and inner lines).
"J-THRU/ICOCA, Suica of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and TOICA of the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), as well as PiTaPa of KANSAI THRU PASS, can be used at all stations on the JR Kyoto Line."
The Hanwa Line's train operation management system has been introduced throughout the line.
It is operated integrally with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"Not only the special rapids, rapid services and local trains (Keihanshin Kankosen), which are directly connected to the JR Kobe and Biwako lines, but also the limited express trains bound for the Hokuriku District, Kansai International Airport, or the Sanin District, etc., run on the line."
Nearly half of the local trains share the same track with the Fukuchiyama Line to Shin-Sanda Station.
"With the privatization to JR, many trains (as follows) started going through to Kyoto Station: the overnight train service bound for Kyushu, which was departing from and arriving at Shin-Osaka; the limited express starting from Tennoji Station for Nanki; and the limited express 'Hakuto,' bound for Sanin district, which started operation with the establishment of Chizu Express Co., Ltd., thus generating a dramatic increase in the number of trains running in this section."
"Particularly, the airport express 'Haruka,' which began operating with the inauguration of Kansai International Airport, started going through to Kyoto on a regular basis within one year, and the section between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become a limited express highway where, together with other trains such as the limited express 'Raicho' bound for the Hokuriku District, about four limited trains run every hour."
"On the other hand, the overnight express service for Kyushu, which departed from and arrived at Kyoto, was completely abolished when the timetable was revised on March 15, 2008."
"Moreover, the outbound limited express trains starting from Shin-Osaka and entering to the Hanwa Line through the Osaka loop Line, such as the airport express 'Haruka' and limited express 'Kuroshio,' enter the freight line at the Ibaraki Station Yard (departure number 3) and proceed to Shin-Osaka Station via Suita signal station."
"That is why it takes a little more time than the limited express or special rapids running on the outer line of the same section, and in a certain time slot two limited express trains proceed onto the tracks at the same time at Shin-Osaka Station."
"Over nearly the entire section between Kyoto and Osaka, the line has extremely good lineation that permits the train to run at 130 km/h in the outer line, except for some curved sections."
"The inner line also permits the trains to run at 120 km/h, but higher-category trains don't use the inner line (except deadheads or special trains)."
The following are the higher-category trains that run on this section of the line.
"In addition, the 'Hamakaze,' 'Tanba' and 'Kitakinki' limited express trains use this spur track to enter and leave the depot when they're deadheaded to Mukomachi Station (Kyoto General Operation Station)."
"On the other hand, the 'Thunderbird,' 'Raicho' and 'Kitaguni' limited express trains proceed via the Hoppo Freight Line when they're deadheaded in the section between Mukomachi Station and Osaka Station."
"When the outbound train that ends at Osaka Station is deadheaded to the depot of Kyoto General Operation Station, it goes outbound from Osaka Station, and after passing Tsukamoto Station it enters the Hoppo Freight Line from the west side in order to directly join the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (and to start from the depot, the train turns back on the same route)."
"Therefore, when the train enters or leaves the depot, the unit of cars becomes inverted."
"The special rapid service proceeding from the direction of Himeji Station on the JR Kobe Line or Aboshi /Kamigori /Ako stations on the Sanyo Main Line goes through to Nagahama Station on the Biwako Line or Omi-Shiotsu /Tsuruga stations on the Hokuriku Main Line, passing through the JR Kyoto Line."
"From the daytime to the nighttime, the train runs every 15 minutes, and out of the trains bound for Kyoto Station one goes through to the Kosei Line while the other three go through to the Biwako Line during the daytime."
"During the nighttime, all four trains go through to the Biwako Line."
"All trains use the cars of the JR (West) Suburban Train Series 223, model No. 1000s or the JR (West) Suburban Train Series 223, model No. 2000s, and they're operated in units of eight or 12 cars."
"Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway, which is approximately 100 km long, is an arterial high-standard highway (National Highway 478) extending from Kumiyama Town, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"The expressway runs through the long, narrow Kyoto Prefecture from north to south, contributing to enhanced regional cooperation between north and south and the promotion of regional activation, and acts as a belt line in the southern urban areas of Kyoto City, which otherwise lack adequate high-standard road networks."
"Kyoto Governor describes this expressway as ""Kyoto no Sebone,"" or the backbone of Kyoto."
"Until now, three sections have opened in three different areas: on the side of the starting point, around the middle, and on the side of the terminal. The section on the side of the staring point has opened under the name ""Keiji Bypass"" instead of ""Jukan Jidoshado Expressway."""
"When people say ""Kyoto Jukan Jidoshado Expressway,"" many may be referring only to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"Its roadway will not end at the Miyazu-Amanohashidate Interchange but will extend to the Tottori Jidoshado Expressway and the Tottori Interchange of the Sanin Jidoshado Expressway as a local high-standard highway, being the Tottori Toyoka Miyazu Jidosha Expressway."
"The section between the Kumiyamayodo Interchange and the Oyamazaki Junction/Interchange is a national expressway on which a minimum speed limit is enforced; consequently, small and compact vehicles are prohibited."
"Accordingly, the equipment for ETC is now being installed at the Miyazu-Amanohashidate Interchange, as well as at the Maizuru-oe Interchange of the Ayabe Miyatsu Road,"
and special-purpose vehicles exceeding 2.5 m in width are banned from the road.
Toll road sections (the Ayabe Miyatsu Road is operated by Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation and others are operated by West Nippon Expressway Corporation Limited)
"Now there is no exit between the Ayabekita Tollgate (Ayabe Junction) and the Ayabe Ankokuji Tollgate, so drivers aren't allowed to run only toll-free sections."
"The Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation will operate the section between the Kyotanba-wachi Interchange and the Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange, which was scheduled to open in the period from summer to autumn of 2008, when the Corporation would take responsibility for the section between the Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange and the Ayabe Junction, and on this occasion the current toll-free section would become a toll road."
"Consequently, the current Ayabekita toll barrier (Ayabe Junction) will be replaced by the Ayabe Ankokuji Tollbooth."
"(The Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange has no tollbooth, but when the new tollbooth is built at the interchange the current barrier gate will be removed.)"
The current Ayabekita Toll barrier (Ayabe Junction) is of a prefabricated structure intended specifically for temporary use.
"A project for the construction of the section between the Tanba and Kyotanba-wachi interchanges is being promoted by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism for opening in 2014, but to date the operator has not been indicated."
"February 17, 1988: Opening of the National Highway 9 Oinosaka-Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) as a toll road, and the National Highway 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) as a temporarily toll-free road."
"May 6, 1993: The designation of National Highway 9 was changed to National Highway 478, Kutsukake IC - Chiyokawa IC."
"September 9, 1993: Toll-road service started on the Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC section."
"March 8, 1998: A connection was established to the Maizuru Expressway (the present Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) through the opening of the Ayabe Junction - Maizuru-oe Interchange (temporary two-lane, two-way traffic)."
"On October 1, 2005: Due to the Privatization of Four Highway Public Corporations the transfer of ownership to Japan Expressway Holding and the Debt Repayment and Agency took place, and the management was tranferred to West Nippon Expressway Company Limited"

"Enryaku-ji Temple is in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses Mt. Hiei - at a height of 848m in its temple precincts."
"It is more often called Mt. Hiei or Eizan, rather than Enryaku-ji Temple."
"Because it was to the north of Heiankyo (Kyoto), it was also called Hokurei (north mountain)."
"It is the central institution of the Japanese Tendai Sect, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
"Its chief priest is called Tendai Zazu, and he supervises its branch temples."
"After Saicho founded it, it was the center of Heian Buddhism along with Kongobu-ji Temple on Mt. Koya."
"It became a general university of Buddhism, spreading the teachings of Tendai Hokke, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation), and Nenbutsu, and in the Heian period gained the support of the Imperial Household and nobles, thereby becoming quite powerful."
"The incantations of esoteric Buddhism especially garnered the support of the Heian nobility; and Enryaku-ji Temple's esoteric Buddhism was called Taimitsu, to distinguish it from the teachings of the Shingon sect's To-ji temple, called Tomitsu."
"""Enryaku-ji Temple"" is the collective name for the temple buildings of the Santo-Jurokudani, including Todo, Saito and Yokawa, spread out between the top of Mt. Hiei and its eastern foot."
It began in 788 (Enryaku 7) when Saicho built a thatched hut that he called Ichijoshikan-in Temple.
"The use of the name of the era in which it was built (Enryaku) for the temple's name was approved after Saicho's death, in 824."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has been called the mother of Japanese Buddhism, because it produced countless famous monks: Ennin, who laid the foundations of Japanese Tendai Buddhism; Enchin; Ryonin, the founder of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect; Honen, the founder of the Jodo sect; Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shin sect; Eisai, the founder of the Rinzai sect; Dogen, the founder of the Soto sect; Nichiren, the founder of the Nichiren sect; and many others, including founders of new sects and famous figures in the history of Japanese Buddhism spent their early years training at Mt. Hiei."
Mt. Hiei also appears in numerous literary works.
"Furthermore, such strenuous training practices as the ""12 Year Mountain Training"", and the ""1000 Day Circumambulation"" continue to this day; and it has even been registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its status as a important, sacred site in Japanese Buddhism."
"Mt. Hiei is mentioned in the Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), is thought to have been the focus of mountain worship from ancient times; and the landlord deity of Mt. Hiei, Oyamakui-no-kami, is enshrined at Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine at the eastern foot of the mountain."
"Saicho's profane name was Hirono MITSUNOOBITO; and he was born in 766 (some accounts say 767) in the Shiga district of Omi province (present-day Shiga Prefecture, Otsu City)."
"In 780 when he was 15 years old, he took Buddhist orders under the monk Gyohyo at Omi's provincial temple, and took the name Saicho."
"In 785 when he was 20, he received the commandments of Buddhism at Nara's Todai-ji Temple, thereby officially becoming a monk."
"The young Saicho had a few thoughts, and did not seek a stable position in one of Nara's big temples, only wanting to train and study scriptures close to home on Mt. Hiei."
"Of all the scriptures, Saicho thought the teachings of Hokekyo (the Lotus Sutra) was the greatest, and studied the ""Three Great Works of Hokke"" by China's Tiantai master Zhiyi (Hokkegengi, Hokkemongu, and Makashikan)."
"In 788 Saicho built a small temple on the site of the present-day Konponchudo Hall, which consisted of Yakushido Hall, Monjudo Hall, and Kyozo (scripture repository), and he called it Ichijoshikan-in Temple."
"This temple, called Hieizan-ji Temple, was allowed to use the name of the era and came to be called Enryaku-ji Temple in 824, after Saicho's death."
"Because then Emperor Kanmu became a devout believer in Saicho and Hieizan-ji Temple, received the support of the emperor and his aides in the Wake clan, it flourished as it was considered the guardian of Kyoto's Kimon (northeast) gate and of the nation."
"In 802, Saicho was approved to travel to Tang China as a Gengakusho (a short-term overseas training student)."
He went to Tang on the ship of Imperial embassies in 804.
"Saicho proceeded to the holy site of Mt. Tiantai, where he learned the Tiantai doctrine and Bodhisattva precepts from Dozui, a descendant of Tiantai master Zhiyi, and the Tiantai doctrine from a chief priest named Gyoman."
He also learned the esoteric teachings from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from the Reverend Shakunen at Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing).
"According to ""Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters)"" and ""Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan),"" Tsukuyomi was born from Izanagi."
"Generally, Tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon who rules the night, but some oppose this view (as discussed later)."
Tsukuyomi is also referred to as Tsukiyomi.
"Based on the story that Tsukuyomi killed Ukemochi no kami (the god of whole grain) with a sword in ""Nihon Shoki,"" this god is generally considered to be male; however, there is no description in ""Kojiki"" or ""Nihon Shoki"" that determines the gender of this god."
Some scholars argue that Tsukuyomi is female because the myths of many other countries depict the god of the moon as female (and even militant) and that the story of killing Ukemochi no kami isn't decisive enough to conclude that Tsukuyomi is male.
"Although Tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon, his (or her) divinity varies from one literary source to the next."
"According to ""Kojiki,"" Tsukuyomi was born from the right eye of Izanagi as she purified herself when running back home from Yomi (the world after death), as well as Amaterasu from her left eye and Susanoo from her nose, and together they comprise Mihashira no uzuno miko (the three noble children)."
"On the other hand, in ""Nihon Shoki"" Tsukuyomi was born from Izanagi's left eye or a masokagami (bronze mirror) held in her right hand, and his (or her) ruling area is different from story to story-at one time the heavens and at another the ocean."
"Tsukuyomi was born in a pair with Amaterasu, the god of the sun, and this idea is, in comparison mythology, common across various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese Pangu legend ""Gounrekinenki"" there is a story of the origin of the sun and moon, which states that Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon as he died, while in Greek mythology Apollo (the god of the sun) and Artemis (the god of the moon) are depicted as twins."
"(Note that Apollo was initially a different god than Helios, the god of the sun; eventually they came to be regarded as identical.)"
"Additionally, the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament of the Bible tells a story about the creation of the sun and moon, stating that God created the two great sources of light-the sun and the moon floating in the heavens--four days after the Creation, and then separated light and darkness by having the sun and the moon rule the day and night, respectively."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is in keeping with a story common throughout the world: that the sun and moon were created as a pair.
"Although in Japanese mythology Tsukuyomi is considered equally as important as Amaterasu and Susanoo, he (or she) appears in ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihon Shoki"" much less often and is generally less active."
"The story of Tsukuyomi is told only in Document 1 of Section 11 of Chapter 5 of ""Nihon Shoki,"" where the origin of whole grain is described."
"Some say this is an effort to strike a balance by placing a quiet, inactive god between two gods of contrasting characteristics: Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Similar structures are seen with Ameno minakanushi no kami against Takamimusubi and with Kamimusubi, and Hosesuri against Hoori (Yamasachihiko) and Hoderi (Umisachihiko)."
"This is referred to as the ""hollow structure"" of Japanese mythology."
"Some consider that Tsukuyomi and Susanoo are identical, because their ruling areas and episodes are somewhat the same."
"In the first part of ""Kojiki,"" Tsukuyomi was born from Izanagi no mikoto as she rinsed her right eye and, together with her other children Amaterasu and Susanoo, is called Mihashira no tattokiko (the three noble children)."
"Although Tsukuyomi no mikoto was instructed to rule the country of the night, none of his subsequent activities is stated."
Some say that Tsukuyomi was ordered to rule Yomi (the world after death) where Izanami no kami had lived.
"Chapter 5 of ""Jindaiki (Records of the Period of Gods)"" in ""Nihon Shoki"" gives a short description of Tsukuyomi, stating that Izanagi gave birth to the god of the brilliant moon next to the sun and sent him (or her) to the heavens to work with the sun as a ruling god, while in Document 1 of Section 1 that follows, Izanagi no mikoto is said to have given birth to Ohirume no mikoto by holding a masokagami (bronze mirror) in her left hand and Tsukuyomi no mikoto by holding the same mirror in her right hand."
"Although there are several stories about the territory of Tsukuyomi, who was instructed to rule the heavens together with Amaterasu Omikami, another story claims that Tsukuyomi was ordered to control the ebb and flow of the tide (which may stem from the idea that the moon controls the tides), thus suggesting that there are several stories about the birth of the three gods."
"According to Document 1 of Section 11 of Chapter 5 in ""Nihon Shoki,"" both Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no mikoto were ordered to rule the heavens, but later Tsukiyomi no mikoto was told by Amaterasu Omikami in the world above to meet Ukemochi no kami (the god of grains), so he (or she) visited her."
"In trying to entertain Tsukiomi by offering him (or her) food and sake, Ukemochi no kami is said to have vomited rice from her mouth, which disgusted her guest and caused him (or her) to slaughter her with a sword."
"Cows, horses, silkworms and rice plants were born from her body, and this is said to be the origin of cereal grain."
"Onmyoji (pronounced as on-myo-ji or on-yo-ji, meaning oracle) was the name of a government post in the Onmyoryo (Bureau of Divination) of the Nakatsukasasho (Central Affairs Ministry) under the Ritsuryo legal system of ancient Japan."
"Onmyoji, who were assigned as hogi (otherwise known as a gikan, meaning a bureaucrat with specialized skills), originally performed only senzei and chiso (rituals performed to determine lucky and unlucky directions) using Onmyodo, which is based on the principles of Inyo gogyo (Yin-Yang and the Five Elements), but later were given responsibility for all divinations, magic, and religious services outside the provisions of the Ritsuryo legal system."
"After the medieval period, Onmyoji referred mainly to non-bureaucrats who performed divination, magic, and religious services independently among the civilian population in various locations, today, they are a type of Shinto-priest who recite prayers and perform divination in the private sector."
It may be pronounced as 'on-yo-ji' without applying tone sandhi.
"The principles of inyo gogyo, that began in the Xia and Shang Dynasties and nearly completed within the Zhou Dynasty, assume that every event occurs due to certain combinations of inyo together with the principles of gogyo or astronomy, calendar, eki and clock, all closely linked to inyo gogyo, and were introduced to Japan directly from mainland China (Han/Sui) or via the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo/Baekje) during the Asuka Period in the 5th and 6th centuries, or, at the latest, when Gokyo Hakase in 512, and Eki Hakase in 554 from Baekje, visited Japan."
"While the effect of these principles on politics and culture was insignificant at first, after Kanroku, the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje in 602 and lectured to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku), they began to have a major impact on national politics."
"The influence of inyo gogyo became significant when the almanac (Genka-reki or Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar for the first time in Japan, and when Kenzuishi (Japanese delegates to the Sui Dynasty) were dispatched to the culturally advanced Sui commencing in 607 to absorb Buppo (Law of Buddhism/ Dharma), the principles of Inyo Gogyo and rekiho (method of making calendars), and when the Seventeen-Article Constitution and Twelve-cap rank system were established by Shotoku taishi."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to strive to absorb additional knowledge by having students accompany Kenzuishi (and subsequently Kentoshi, the Japanese delegations to visit the Tang Dynasty) and by inviting numerous Buddhist monks and scholars from Mainland China or various ports of call from the Korean Peninsula."
"As the introduction of these learnings progressed, a perception developed, whereby, to ""predict the future and receive guidance for everything concerning human life by studying the movements and positions of nichigetsuseishin (the sun, the moon, and the stars) and to judge good, bad, auspicious or harmful signs based upon the principles of gogyo and the way of productive and conflicting relationships in the natural world"" became important and greater faith in the principles of inyo gogyo as a measure used to establish codes of conduct by judging good and bad fortunes."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of tenmontonko who personally performed divinations with a choku during the Jinshin War and who had great knowledge of the principles of inyo gogyo, set up 'Onmyoryo' and Japan's first senseidai (astrology station) in 676."
"In 685, as the principles of inyo gogyo grew more popular, with the term 'onmyoji' starting to be used, it was put into statutory form to install Onmyoryo as a ryo (in line with the ritsuryo system) as a division of Department of Nakatsukasasho, by the ritsuryo formally announced in the Yoro period in 718 and when it was stipulated that tenmon hakase, onmyo hakase, onmyoji, reki hakase, and rokoku hakase be made permanent posts as gikan (bureaucrats with specialized skills), they began to officially perform divinations alongside jingikan (a bureaucrat in charge of Shinto ceremonies) who were responsible for kiiboku (fortune telling using turtle shells)."
"Since hogi was responsible for the arts being brought over from the continent, toraijin (foreigners that came to Japan) were well versed in the various learnings with good reading skills in the Chinese classics, who were generally from Eastern Han, Western Han, or Sui that gained supremacy in place of the Hans in Mainland China, as well as Goguryeo/Baekje that had power in western Korean Peninsula, and, in rare cases, scholar monks from Silla that were powerful in eastern Korean Peninsula at that time were appointed as various hakase or onmyoji."
"In particular, later in 663, during the fall of the Baekje Dynasty after losing the Baekgang War when Japan had sent reinforcements to its ally Baekje and Silla consolidated the Korean Peninsula, a large number of experts in various fields came to Japan as refugees and many of them were subsequently appointed to government posts."
"When Onmyoryo was first set up, as hogi's duties only consisted of seizen, chiso (something like the present 'Feng Shui'), astronomy, astrology, calendar-making, judging lucky and unlucky days and the clock, they exclusively worked to observe astronomy, to manage the calendar and clock and to make predictions on good and bad luck concerning events using logical analyses based on inyo gogyo, while never performing religious ceremonies or magic rituals like jingikan or monks, they played a key role in selecting lucky days when building or reconstruction work was required at the Imperial Court and performed divinations for lucky and unlucky properties/directions for relocating the capital."
Structure of Onmyoryo and duties of onmyoji under the Ritsuryo System
"At Onmyoryo, as executive officers who are administrative officials,"
"The position that manages Onmyoryo to supervise all work related to astronomy, the calendar, wind/clouds and atmospheric conditions, when abnormal conditions occur, to seal the record to make sure information is not leaked outside and private reports to the Emperor (tenmon misso (reporting unusual astronomical phenomena to the emperor)), to submit the new year's calendar developed by reki hakase by November 1 of the year (goryakuso (submission of the next year's calendar)), and reporting the outcome of senzei and chiso to the Emperor each time they are performed."
