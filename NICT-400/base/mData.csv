"The founding spirit of Doshisha is ""conscience"" based on the Christian spirit."
"The purpose of the founding of the university was to cultivate ""people who can use their conscience as a skill."""
"In order not to be biased toward knowledge education, he hoped to produce people who were ""full of conscience"" by promoting ""virtue education"" based on Christianity in parallel."
"There are monuments engraved with his thoughts in his handwriting at various schools such as Doshisha University."

"In addition, ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" have been set forth as educational philosophies to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, and through these principles, we aim to produce people who are ""the conscience of a nation."""
"It is a Christian Protestant school corporation and follows the flow of the Congregational Church (Union Church)."
"However, it differs in nature from so-called mission universities in that it does not have the main purpose of Christian evangelism (education itself is not a means of evangelism)."

"There is no one in the world who knows you."""
"His childhood name is Senkikumaru according to later historical sources."

"(For the names of the precepts and the names of the roads, please refer to the ""Names of the Commandments"" section.) )"
"At the age of six, he was initiated into the Statue Outside Collection of Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto, and was named Shujian."
"He excelled in poetry from an early age, and his Chinese poem ""Nagato Harukusa"" at the age of 13 and the Chinese poem ""Spring Clothes and Flowers"" at the age of 15 were popular and praised in Rakuchu."
"In the 17th year of Onei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken Ō Soi and changed his name to Sōjun."
"At this time, it is not possible to determine whether Ikkyu was due to the transfer of his teacher, but he attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Onei (1415), he became a disciple of the high priest of Daitokuji Temple in Kyoto, Kaso Sodon."
"In response to the public proposal of ""The Stick of the Three Caves"", he replied, ""From Ariroji, return to Muroji, take a break, rain and rain, blow the wind"", so he was given the name of the Way of Ikkyu by Huaji."
"In addition, ""Ariroji (有leaking path)"" refers to the world of confusion (disturbing thoughts), and ""無ろじ (無ろじ (無leaking path)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in the 27th year of Onei (1420), he heard the crow chirping and suddenly became enlightened."
"Hua Yi tries to give him a seal of approval, but Ikkyu declines."
"Hua Yu laughed at the fool and sent him off."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, rhapsody, calligraphy, and wind madness."
"In the first year of Shocho (1428), Emperor Shōkō died without leaving any male children, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi family and enthroned."
"It is said that Emperor Go-Hanazono's enthronement was recommended by Ikkyu."
"From ""Tokai Ikkyu Washo Chronicle""."
"However, Yoshio Imaizumi states that Emperor Go-Hanazono's accession to the throne was due to the approval of the shogunate, and that Ikkyu's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In the 6th year of civilization after the Onin Rebellion (1474), he was appointed as the 47th resident of Daitokuji Temple by the royal decree of Emperor Godo Mikado, and although he did not live in the temple, he was instrumental in its revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is an imperial palace located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Meiji Restoration's trip to Tokyo, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace (formerly Edo Castle) in Tokyo, so it was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"After the Meiji era, it is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official imperial palace in Heian-kyo was Uchiura, located near the center of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to Satonai-ura due to devastation caused by war."
"The inner back of the Tsuchimimon Higashi-dong Temple is one of the inner circles of this village, and was the imperial palace where the imperial family of the Mochimei-in dynasty, which would later be called the Northern Dynasty, resided in successive generations."
"By the way, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji Temple, which would be called the Southern Dynasty, was in the back of Nijo Tomikoji."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the inner and outer part of the Tsuchimimon Todoin itself, but is an expansion based on the inner lining of the Tsuchimimon Todoin Temple."
"It is usually open to the public in spring and autumn."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the trip to Tokyo in 1869 (Meiji 2)."
"The current (21st century) Kyoto Imperial Palace is state-owned property and is classified as ""imperial property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to it are the Kyoto Omiya Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both schools are located on the Imadegawa Campus) across Imadegawa-dori to the north."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, the Kyoto Omiya Imperial Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, and the surrounding Kyoto Imperial Garden, which is a national park, is managed by the Ministry of the Environment."
"The citizens of Kyoto, including the Kyoto Imperial Garden, often refer to it simply as ""Gosho"" (Gosho)."
"Unlike castles overseas, the walls covering the palace are not very high, but there is a consideration that this reflects the difference in the affinity of the common people to the rulers (such as the emperor and other imperial families) in the East and the West."
"For example, one of the grounds for this consideration is that during the French Revolution, there were no cases in Japan where ordinary people invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king)."
"At the beginning of the founding of Heian-kyo, the inner lining was located considerably west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, northeast of the Senbon-Marutamachi intersection near Nijo Station of the West Japan Railway Company."
"The existing Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the back of the village, called Tsuchimikado Higashi-in-den, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Dynasty (Japan) in 1331."
"The inner lining of this place was rebuilt eight times in the Edo period alone (six of which were rebuilt by fire), and the existing building was rebuilt in the second year of Ansei (1855) at the end of the Edo period, following the Heian style, and is called Ansei Uchiura."
"In the 10th year of the Meiji Era (1877), when Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair less than 10 years after his visit to Tokyo, and ordered that the Imperial Palace be preserved and the old view should be maintained."
"The main buildings are the Shishinden Palace, the Seiryo Palace, the Kogosho, the Imperial Academy, the Tsunegoten Palace, the Koshun Palace, the Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony was held at the Shiyoden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the enthronement ceremony and the Imperial Ceremony were to be held in Kyoto according to the old imperial family code established in Meiji 22 (1889), and Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also held the enthronement ceremony at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"In addition, in the current Imperial Family Code established after World War II, there is no particular provision for the place to be held in Kyoto, and in 1990, on the occasion of the enthronement of Emperor Hirohito, the enthronement ceremony was held at the main hall of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The High Throne, which is the official throne room of the Emperor where the Emperor is seated at the time of his enthronement and the enthronement is symbolically indicated, is located in the Purple Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"It is a four-legged gate with bare wood, gabled structure, cypress bark thatch, and one space between pillars."
"The gate is only opened on special occasions, such as visits by the emperor, dignitaries, and state guests, or when it is open to the public."
"The Tsukiji fence on the left and right has five streaks (horizontal lines), which also show the highest formality as a fence."
"When you enter this gate and pass through the tan-painted tile-roofed Jomeimon Gate, you will see the Purple Palace in front of you."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula and Vietnam."
"In the following, I will focus on Japan's gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) handed down to the Imperial Household Agency's Shikibu Vocational Music Department."
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""the dance of the music of the gagaku"", which is the opposite of ""folk music""."
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency's Formal Music Department in Japan, Western music is excluded among the songs performed by the Imperial Household Agency's Ceremony Department."
"Many of them are instrumental pieces that have been inherited as court music."
"It is still the world's oldest style of traditional music performed in a large-scale ensemble."
"However, the original ensemble form of gagaku was disconnected for more than 100 years from the Onin War until the Tokugawa shogunate reorganized it by bringing together the descendants of musicians (musicians), so it is questionable to what extent it has inherited the form of the Heian period."
"The characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century have been conveyed as they are, such as the pronunciation of the Ha line as fafifu fefo when singing the score written in katakana as a chanting song (ginger (singing with verses attached to the letters of the score to memorize the melody), and it is speculated that the overall reproduction is quite faithful."
"Those written in Chinese characters, such as the music scores of the raku biwa, have many similarities with the biwa notation found in Dunhuang, China, and many styles handed down from the old continent have been inherited."
"One of the most important historical sources is the Taigensho, written by Toyohara Tōshu (1450~1512) who was concerned that records of gagaku and other music would be scattered due to the Onin War."
"This is a compilation of records on gagaku and bugaku centered on sho by the sho's musician Tōshu, and is a valuable record of gagaku in the old era."
"It is based on ceremonial music from China, the Korean Peninsula and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music held at ceremonies."
"However, among the songs currently performed in gagaku in Japan, Karagaku, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music that was played at a banquet called Yangaku in Tang."
"As for the categories of music, there are international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yu music (music of Champa), and elements of Japan ancient music from before the introduction of music on the continent are also included."
"Before the modern era, the Tennoji Rakusho (Gakuso) (Osaka City) of Shitennoji Temple, which conveys the oldest style, the Ouchi Rakusho (Kyoto) of the Imperial Palace, and the Nanto Rakusho (Nara City) of Kasuga Taisha were designated as the Sanpo Rakusho."
"In modern times, these music centers were called to Tokyo and became the basis of the current Imperial Household Agency's music clubs, but the tradition of each music center continues in each place."
"In addition, there is a mutual influence with folk songs and statements, and Japan's unique style has been created."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency's Ceremony Department."
"For the lyrics, see S Kokufu Kabu"
"Those that came from outside Japan (there is also a view that only this is gagaku. ）"
"Left-hand dance / Karaku ......... Chinese, Tianzhu (India), and Lin Yu (South Vietnamese)"
"Right Dance, Goryeo Dance......... Korea, Bohai (northeastern region of China)"
"These include songs produced in Japan imitating the above style (Japanese music)."
"Songs created in the Heian period (謡物 うた物)"
"For lyrics, see S Song"
"* National style songs and dances are sometimes collectively referred to as ancient songs."
"Emperor Kanmu (桓武天皇, Kanmu Tenno, Tenpei 9 (737) – March 7, Enreki 25 (April 9, 806)) was the 50th emperor of Japan."
"Emperor Kammu was born in the ninth year of Tenpei (737) as the first prince of King Shirabe (later Emperor Mitsuhito)."
"His mother, Koya Shinkasa, is described in the Japan Chronicle as a descendant of the Baekje royal family, whose ancestor was King Munyeong of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara Otomu made Anden (later Emperor Heijo) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), and Princess Fujiwara Ryoko made Ōban (later Emperor Junwa)."
"Even after the accession to the throne of his father, King Shirakabe, his mother, Takano Shinkasa, was from a low-status naturalized clan, so he was not wanted to be a prince, and at first he aimed to rise through the ranks as a bureaucrat, and served as a chamberlain, head of a university, and lord of lieutenant affairs."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan and others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince Goto, and his mother, Empress Princess Inoueuchi, were suddenly abolished, and on January 2, the 4th year of Hogame (773), he became the Crown Prince."
"He was reluctant to expand the influence of the Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo and moved the capital to Yamashiro Province."
"First, Nagaoka-kyo was built in 784, but Heian-kyo was built again in 794."
"In addition, in order to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate Ezo, he sent an army with Sakaue Tamura Maro as the Seiyi General."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Otsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike for causing the peasants to suffer because of this kind of military and artifice."
"In terms of culture, he is said to have come up with the idea of compiling the Continuation of the Japan Era."
"It was also under Kanbu that Saisumi and Kukai returned from the Tang Dynasty and brought a new movement to Buddhism in Japan."
"There was also a dark side to the unnatural deaths of Prince Inoue and Prince Todo, and the fact that at the beginning of his reign, his younger brother Prince Sawara, who was made Crown Prince, was exiled in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu and died in his office."
"Fearing a grudge, on July 19 of the 19th year of the Enki calendar (800), Prince Sawara was renamed Emperor Sudo, and the tomb of Prince Inoueuchi was renamed Sanryo, and the title of empress was restored."
"While he is known as the protector of Sasumi and Kukai, the existing Buddhism was too involved in the regime and had too much power, so he put pressure on the so-called ""Nanto Six Sects"" by confiscating the seals."
"It is also said that Gomiya was in turmoil, and it became a hotbed that led to the later ""Yakuko's Transformation""."
"Died on March 17, 806."
"He was given the title of Japan Neko Emperor Yateruson."
"At the same time, Emperor Kammu was given as the Hanfu Emperor."
"He was also called Emperor Kashiwabara and Emperor Kashiwabara."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"During his lifetime, he insisted that he be buried in Utano, but for fortune-telling reasons, it became the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
"In the Meiji era, he was enshrined in the Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian Kyoto."
"In addition, all emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three palaces of the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, at a press conference held before the Emperor's birthday, Akihito made a comment on the co-hosting of the following year's FIFA World Cup, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea because it is written in the Japan Chronicle that Emperor Kanmu's birth mother is a descendant of King Munyeong of Baekje."""
"Although this statement was not widely reported in Japan, it was widely reported in the Korean media and became a hot topic."
"Some of them made a big leap in logic, such as ""The Emperor's family is descended from the Korean race"" and ""The theory of the origin of the Imperial Family Baekje."""
"The Ōtani family is the family name of the descendants of Kakue, the son of Kakunobu and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking nobleman in Kyoto, and Kakunobu was the daughter of Shinran, who was the hereditary head of Honganji, the majority of the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"In the Meiji era, when surnames became mandatory, the president of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the president of the Shinshu Oya sect (Shinshu Honmaku), which split in 1602, both used surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the fact that Shinran's mausoleum, which will be described later, was established on the site of Otani at the north gate of Higashiyama Chion-in Temple, Kyoto."
"In the Sengoku period (Japan), Honganji Temple was counted as one of the Sengoku daimyō because it had the power to rival the Sengoku daimyō under the spread of the Putsch, and the legal name of the gatekeeper (Jodo Shinshu) and the proverb with Honganji are often called ""Honganji Kennyo"" or ""Honganji Mitsusa"", but it is only for the convenience of the name, and the family of the Honganji gatekeeper did not take Honganji as the family name and surname of the house. There was no such thing as Mr. Honganji."
"When Shinran died in 1262, Kakunobu took care of his death, and in 1272 he built a hall to bury his remains in Oya near his home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"The Otani temple became the Otani Shrine Hall, which was revered by the disciples of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism as Shinran's shrine, and Kakue, the eldest son of Kakunobu, was to manage it as a resident."
"However, since the Otani Shrine attracted pilgrimage and donations from disciples from all over the world, a dispute later arose between Kakue's son Kakuryo and Kakue's half-brother Yuizen over the position of absentee, and Kakuryo narrowly won and established the hereditary position of the absentee office by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakuryo turned the temple into a temple, and Otani Honganji Temple was born."
"Since then, the Honganji temple inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo has proceeded to form a cult, and at the time of the 5th generation of the Muromachi period, it advanced to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation, the Honganji cult was formed in Kaga Province, Noto Province, Echizen Province, Omi Province, etc."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that have been striving to form a cult since Shinran's death, the formation of the sect lagged far behind, and the Honganji temple in the early Muromachi period is considered to be the last temple of the Seiren-in Temple, and it is said that the Otani family also became a priest of the Kujo family in connection with the Hino family (Shinran's parents' family)."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji cult spread throughout Japan due to the activities of Rennyo, who became the eighth gatekeeper, but in 1465 Otani Honganji Temple was destroyed and the gatekeeper moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen and then to Yamashina Ward on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of the cult of the Rennyo dynasty, the Kaga Rebellion occurred in 1488, and the Honganji cult of Kaga followed the guardian Togashi clan, creating a situation called ""a country ruled by peasants""."
"For about 100 years until 1580, the country was ruled by the Issei sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the turmoil of the Warring States, the Honganji cult became active in various parts of Japan with its organizational power from small peasants to samurai such as samurai and landlords, but Yamashina Honganji was damaged by war in 1532 due to the Tenmon Hoka Rebellion, and the 10th generation of the Honganji moved to Ishiyama Gobo, which Rennyo opened in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and became Ishiyama Honganji."
"Ishiyama Honganji Temple was located at the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau."
"It controlled Osaka, a key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"With Ishiyama Honganji as his headquarters, he sought to establish close ties with the daimyos, the shogunate, and the imperial court, and stabilized the power base of the Honganji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Seiyo era, some Honganji cults in Hokuriku and other regions began to take their own course outside the control of Honganji."
"At the time of the 11th Kennyo, the son of the Honganji cult, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, entered the Kinai area and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified rule by depriving religious forces of territorial power."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan, which lasted for ten years from 1570, the so-called Ishiyama War, was dominated by the cooperation between Kennyo and others who stood in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple and the Honganji monks who were protesting against the Oda clan in various places, and the Honganji temple gained the upper hand, causing Nobunaga great suffering."
"However, in 1574, the Oda clan destroyed the temple in Nagashima Town (Mie Prefecture) in Ise Province, and in 1575, the Ikkoichi rebellion that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was overturned, and in 1578, the water army of the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda water army."
"The Honganji temple still maintained its strength while gathering the support of the Soga people and others, but gradually became isolated among the enemies, and in 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had extracted the edict of Emperor Masachimachi, and left Ishiyama Honganji, and the Honganji temple as a feudal power ceased to exist."
"At this time, the eldest son Kyonyo and Kennyo, who insisted on continuing to resist against Kennyo's wishes, fell out with each other, and when Kennyo died in 1593, his third son, Junnyo, was set up as his successor."
"From this point on, the Honganji Temple began to split over the position of the gatekeeper, and in 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu gave Kyonyo a separate temple site from the Honganji sect of Junnyo and separated the Higashi Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many disciples moved from the Junnyo cult, which became Nishi Honganji, to the Kyonyo of Higashi Honganji, and the Honganji Temple was divided into east and west."
"Originally, Shinran, the son of Hino Arinori of the noble family, and the head of both the East and West Otani families, who drew the bloodline of Hino Hirotsuna (Kakuyo's father), had a custom of becoming the children of powerful noble families for generations, and they had continued to intermarry with the noble family for generations, and the maternal line also promoted the formation of a noble family."
"Kyotanabe City is a city located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, near the border with Osaka and Nara prefectures."
"Kyotanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsurugi District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, and is located in the central part of the triangle zone of Sanfu Prefecture."
"It is sandwiched between the Kizu River (Kyoto Prefecture), which flows north-south on the east side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west side, and the West Japan Railway Katamachi Line and Japan Railway Kintetsu Kyoto Line pass through the center."
"It has a strong character as a bedroom town in Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka."
"On April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), the city system was enforced from Tanabe Town, Tsurugi District."
"It was born in Kyoto Prefecture as the 12th city in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"At that time, in order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, Tanabe Town, Tsurugi District, Kyoto Prefecture, which became ""Kyotanabe City"" with the ""Kyoto"" in Kyoto Prefecture, was disposed of as ""Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" as a city (municipal system enforced), and ""Tanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" was changed to ""Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" on the same day."

"Kintetsu Shintanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station function as the center of Kyotanabe City, and Matsui Yamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"Kintetsu Shintanabe Station is also served by local trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe, and was renamed to match the city name at about the same time as the city system was enforced."
"This is the same case as Nishimukai Station and Higashimukai Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line."
"(In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kise Main Line), but the name of the station in Tanabe City is the former country name of Wakayama Prefecture ""Kii"", which seems to be to avoid duplication of station names within the jurisdiction of the same West Japan Railway Company.)"

"In the Enki ceremony, the rank is the classification of the country of the country, and the country of the distant country."
"Heian-kyo is the capital of Japan established by Emperor Kammu in 794 (Enreki 13)."
"Heian-kyo was built on land straddling both Kuzuno and Atago counties in Yamashiro Province, which is the center of present-day Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, and was a rectangular castle divided into rectangles 4.5 km from east to west and 5.2 km from north to south."
"It is said that the Ouchi Uraura will be set up in the center of the northern end of the capital, and from there in the center of the city through Suzaku Oji, Sakyo and Ukyo (Sakyo on the east side and Ukyo on the west side) will be placed on the left and right"
"The plan basically follows the Heicheng Jing, and follows the Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"But the city walls did not exist."
"There is also a theory that the selection of this site was based on the idea of the four gods based on Feng Shui, which was transmitted from China."
"The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current city of Kyoto."

"The estimated location of Nishikyogoku Oji at the western limit is a line connecting Hanazono Station on the West Japan Railway Sanin Main Line (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishikyogoku Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line of the Hankyu Electric Railway from north to south."
"Kyonai was divided into 40 square ""towns"" by large roads and small streets running north, south, east, and west."
"A collection of four rows of towns in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the north side) is called a ""jo"", and a collection of four rows in a north-south direction is called a ""bo""."
"Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same article was numbered."
"As a result, each town was called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo 14 Towns""."
"The width of the road was 4 jo (about 12 m) even on the small road, and more than 8 jo (about 24 m) on the main road."
"Most of the roads in Kyoto are much narrower than this."
"Suzaku Boulevard was 28 feet (about 84 m) wide."
"In addition, rivers (Horikawa (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishihorikawa Koji) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji."
"In 784, Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Yamaback Province and built Nagaoka-kyo."
"However, it is said that this was intended to break away from Yamato Province, where the power of aristocrats and temples gathered to support the regime of Emperor Temmu, and to build a new capital of Emperor Tenchi."
"However, only 10 years later, in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of the mountainous province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of disturbances from the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu in Nagaoka-kyo to the abolition of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress in the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
"It is thought that the construction of Heian-kyo began with Miyagi (Ouchiura) and then with the construction of Kyoto (city)."
"However, since the land of Ukyo is a marshland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), it was not converted into a residential area even in the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the ritsuryō system was almost a formality, it fell into disrepair and was even converted to farmland that was originally prohibited in Kyoto."
"The residential areas where the nobles lived were established in Sakyo, except for the northern part of Ukyo, which is close to the Ouchi Ura."
"The Japan Later Period is a book of imperial history compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third in the history of the Six Kingdoms following the Japan period."
"It was completed in the 7th year of Johwa (Japan) (840), and describes the 42 years from the 11th year of Enreki (792) to the 10th year of Tencho (833)."
"The editor is Otsugu Fujiwara et al."
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Hirohito (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara Otsugu, Fujiwara Sadatsugu, and Ryōsaki Yasuyo to compile the book."
"Since all but three of them died before the end of the war, Emperor Junwa later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Naoyo, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Takemori, Sakagami Imatsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"In the reign of Emperor Hirohito, he ordered Fujiwara Otsugu, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori to carry it out."
"Later, Furu Takaba and Yamada Koji were added, and finally reported its completion on December 9, Jowa 7 (January 5, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile the book, and Fujiwara Otsugu was the only one who was involved in the project that spanned three emperors."
"Following the ""Continuation of the Japan Era"", the reigns of Emperor Heijo, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junwa are recorded from the middle of the reign of Emperor Kammu."
"Until the beginning of the 15th century, there were 40 volumes, but they were subsequently scattered, and it was published for the first time when Inayama Yukinori, a disciple of Hanabo Kiichi, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes in the Sanjo Nishike family (there is also a theory that it was edited by Yanagihara Norimitsu as an alternative theory)."
"There are 10 extant volumes: volumes 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijo), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), and the reign of Emperor Junwa is completely missing."
"The text can be reconstructed to some extent from the quotations of the ""Japan Chronicle"", which is an excerpted version of the History of the Six Kingdoms, and the ""History of the Six Kingdoms"", which is an itemized classification of the history of the Six Kingdoms."
"The collection of anecdotes from various places is ""Japan Itsushi"" and ""Japan Goki Itsubun"", and based on this, the following Shueisha translation notes Japan historical materials and Kodansha academic paperback have been published."
"It is said that the opinion of Fujiwara Otsugu was most reflected in the content."
"The addition of short biographies (薨伝) to the obituaries of the emperor and courtiers follows the ""Continuation of the Japan Period"" and is the same as subsequent history books."
"However, the biography of this book does not flow into one-sided or official praise or condemnation, but has many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, and is unique in the history of the Six Kingdoms as it adheres to the spirit of criticism."
"In addition, it is known that in the history of the Six Kingdoms, more waka poems were recorded than in the history books before and after."
"Sei Shonagon (Sei Shonagon, around the third year of Kangbo (966?) - Around the second year of Manju (1025?) ) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period."
"There is also a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"She was the late daughter of Gensuke Kiyohara (908-990), one of the ""Five Men of the Pear Pot"" and a famous poet."
"There is an old tradition that says that her mother is ""Higaki no Ouna"" as seen in the ""Later Waka Poetry"", but this is only a wild theory."
"His great-grandfather (some say his grandfather) was the father of Kiyohara Fuka, a representative poet of ancient and modern waka poetry."
"Among his brothers and sisters were the Gagaku Head Yoshinari, Dazai Shosho Nobunobu, Hanayama-in Temple, and Fuji Hara Noh (Fujiwara Michitsuna's brother)."
"It is said that ""Kiyo Shonagon"" is the name of his wife, ""Kiyo"" is taken from the surname of Kiyohara, and ""Shonagon"" is taken from the title of a relative."
"Her real name is unknown, and there is a theory that she is ""Nagiko"", but it is not believable."
"He is counted as one of the 36 used kasen, and is a collection of 42 small houses, ""Kiyo Shao Na Genshu"" (The number of songs is according to different books. In the rufu book, 31 necks) are transmitted."
"Collected in 14 collections of poems."
"Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th Seiyi Daishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reigned: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588))."
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother is the daughter of Naomichi Konoe, Keijuin."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is the same mother and brother."
"At first, he was a monk, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other shogunates."
"Then, he was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and became the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga and established a siege of Nobunaga in response to Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage."
"At one point, he pursued Nobunaga, but he was eventually expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, effectively destroying the Muromachi shogunate."
"After that, he lived the rest of his life with the assistance of Terumoto Mori and Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"Born on November 13, 1537, the second son of Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun."
"Since his older brother had a son, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, he became the son of his grandfather, Konoe Naomichi, at a young age, and entered the Buddhist gate (Kofukuji Ichijo-in) and took the name Kakukei."
"Later, he flourished to the rank of Gonsha monk at Kofukuji."
"In the 8th year of Eiroku (1565), his elder brother Yoshiteru, who was the 13th shogun, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hide and the Miyoshi Sanninshu, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Shutaka, who was the head of the Shikaen-in Temple, was also kidnapped."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hide and others and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple (Hisahide and others are said to have been imprisoned for fear that killing Kakukei would turn Kofukuji into an enemy because he was the shogun's younger brother and had been promised a position in Kofukuji Bessatsu in the future)."
"However, he escaped with the help of the shogunate Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Yoshimasa, and on February 17, 1566, in the ninth year of Eiroku, he returned to Japan and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In the book describing Yoshiaki, it is recorded that he was also called the Samurai Palace."
"It is said that when he was driven out of Kyoto, he was attacked by bandits at night and was also called ""the poor prince""."
"On April 21, he was secretly ordained and commissioned as a subordinate to the fifth rank."
"Although there are some doubts about the timing of his investiture, according to Yamashina Gentsugu's ""Chronicle of the Lord of Words"", it is clear that he was confused because a messenger of Yoshiaki appeared at the residence of Gontsugu, who was an emissary of Yoshiaki, on the day of the shogun's proclamation to Ashikaga Yoshihide, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568) and came to mediate the recommendation of promotion to the fourth rank."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki initially relied on Rokkaku Yoshiken and Rokkaku Yoshiharu in Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly communicated with the Miyoshi Sanjinshu, and in August he defected to his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshinori of Wakasa Province."
"However, due to the family feud and the power struggle between the feudal lords, Wakasa Takeda did not have the ability to rise to the throne, and in September he went into exile under Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and asked for help in reviving the shogun family."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage had already possessed Ashikaga Tsuguchi of the ""Kuramiya Imperial Palace"" of the Ashikaga Shogun family, and he had no intention of actively making an active promotion in favor of Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had just returned to the world, so the Kamiraku did not materialize."
"The crown role is played by Asakura Yoshikage (it should be noted that there are no written historical documents that Yoshiaki officially performed the original clothes up to this point, and it can be said that it was too late for the time)."
"Eventually, through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, who was an important vassal of the Asakura family, he relied on Oda Nobunaga to move to Mino Province."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was defended by Oda Nobunaga and ascended."
"On October 18, he was proclaimed shogun by the Imperial Court and became the 15th shogun."
"At the same time, he was promoted and appointed to the rank of Lieutenant General of the Councillor and Sakonoe Gon."
"JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto Line) is a nickname for the West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station ~ Osaka Station."
"The nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"Almost all sections are parallel to Hankyu Corporation's Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line), and Japan Railways also has a Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which connects at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively, so the nickname ""JR"" is added to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and since it is positioned as the company's main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color as it is."
"It runs parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line on the right bank of the Yodo River, and the new rapid train connects Kyoto ~ Osaka for 42.8 km in as little as 28 minutes (maximum speed is 130 km/h)."
"All sections are double-track (outer line and inner line) by direction."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, J-Thru ICOCA, Suica of the To Japan Railway Company (JR Japan East), TOICA of the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used."
"The Hanwa Line operation management system has been introduced on all lines."
"It is operated as an integral part of the JR Kobe Line and the Lake Biwa Line."
"In addition to the new rapid trains, rapid trains, and local trains (Keihanshin Slow Line) that go directly to the JR Kobe Line and the Lake Biwa Line, there are also special express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San-in region."
"In addition, nearly half of the local trains go to Shinmita Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the conversion to JR, the sleeper limited express to Kyushu, which departed from and arrived at Shin-Osaka, the limited express to Nanki, which departed from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto (train)"" to Sanin, which began operation with the opening of the Chizu Express, began to operate directly to Kyoto, and the number of limited express trains in this section increased dramatically."
"In particular, Haruka (train), which started operation at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, began to enter Kyoto by regular train one year later, and Shin-Osaka ~ Kyoto has become a limited express highway that operates about 4 times a time, including other trains such as the El Limited Express ""Raitori (train)"" in the Hokuriku direction."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express service to and from Kyoto to Kyushu was completely abolished by the revision of the timetable on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the outbound limited express ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio (train)"" that enter the Hanwa Line from Shin-Osaka on the Osaka Loop Line enter the freight line from Ibaraki Station (departure 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita signal station."
"As a result, it takes a little longer than the limited express and new rapid trains that run on the outer line in the same section, and depending on the time of day, two limited express trains may enter Shin-Osaka at the same time."
"The alignment is extremely good over almost the entire line of Kyoto ~ Osaka, and the outer line can operate at 130 km/h except for some curved sections."
"The inner line also supports 120 km/h, but the honor train does not run on the inside (although it is available for round-trip and special trains)."
"The honor trains that run on this section are as follows."
"In addition, due to the entry and exit of Mukohimachi (Kyoto General Driving Station), round-trip trains such as ""Hamakaze (train)"", ""Tamba (train)"", and ""Kitakinki (train)"" run in this section."
"In addition, the ""Mr./Ms."", ""Thunderbird"", and ""Kitaguni"" round-trip trains between Mukaimachi ~ Osaka go via the Northern Freight Line."
"When the outbound Osaka stop train is to enter the Kyoto General Driving Station, proceed downward from Osaka Station, and after passing Tsukamoto Station, enter the Northern Freight Line from the west side and join the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) as it is (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
"The new rapid runs directly from the JR Kobe Line, Himeji, Sanyo Main Line, Aboshi, Kamigun, Ako Line, and Banshu-Ako to the Biwako Line, Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line, Omi-Shiozu Station, and Tsuruga on the Biwako Line."
"From day to night, the train runs every 15 minutes, and one of the trains in Kyoto goes directly to the Kosai Line during the day and the other three go directly to the Lake Biwa Line."
"At night, all four trains go directly to the Lake Biwa Line."
"All trains use JR West Japan 223 series trains 1000 series and JR West Japan 223 series trains 2000 series, and are operated in 8 or 12-car trains."
"The Kyoto Expressway is a high-standard highway (General National Route 478) with a length of about 100 km, starting in Kumiyama Town, Kuze District, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It runs through Kyoto Prefecture, which runs long from north to south, strengthens cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aims to revitalize the region, and serves as the southern outer ring road in the Kyoto city metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this road by saying ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"At present, three locations have been opened: the starting point, the central part, and the end side, and the starting point side has been opened under the name of the Keiji Bypass instead of the Kyoto Expressway."
"In addition, in general, it is often referred to as the Kyoto Highway by referring only to the Kyoto Tamba Road."
"The main line on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side will not end here, but will be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the Sanin Expressway as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road."
"In addition, since the section of Kumiyama Yodo IC ~ Oyamazaki JCT / IC is a high-speed automobile national highway, the minimum speed is applied, and it is impossible to pass through small specials."
"For this reason, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
"Special vehicles over 2.5 meters wide are not allowed to pass."
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation, others are managed by West Japan Expressway)"
"Currently, there is no exit between the Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to run only in the free section."
"Kyotanba Wachi IC ~ Ayabe Ankokuji Temple, which is scheduled to open in the summer ~ autumn of 2008, is scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation, and at that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC ~ Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Public Corporation, so the Ayabe Ankokuji IC ~ Ayabe JCT, which is currently a free section, will also be charged."
"Along with this, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll gate will be built."
"As a result, there will be no toll booth on the main line on Ayabe Miyazu Road."
"The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is similar to a prefabricated temporary structure."
"Tamba IC~Kyotanba Wachi IC is currently underway by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in FY2014, but the management system after the opening is still unknown."
"February 17, 1988: General National Highway No. 9 Oronosaka Kameoka Road (Kusukake IC ~ Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and General National Route No. 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC ~ Chiyogawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: Kusukake IC ~ Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC ~ Chiyogawa IC opened as a general toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Ayabe JCT ~ Maizuru Oe IC opened, connecting with the Maizuru Expressway (currently the Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (temporary two-lane two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: Due to the privatization of the four road-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Corporation, and management was transferred to West Japan Expressway Corporation."
"The part where the background color of the IC number column is ■ indicates the section where the road has already been put into service."
"In addition, the part where the background color of the facility name column is ■ indicates that the facility is not in service or has not been completed."
"The name of the unopened section is tentative."
"No BS for unmarked."
"(Number) is the number of other routes."
"&lt; digit &gt; is the planned number."
"Enryakuji Temple is located in Sakamoto-cho, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and is a temple that covers the entire area of Mt. Hiei at an altitude of 848 meters."
"It is often called Mt. Hiei or Mt. Eizan from the name of Enryakuji."
"Since it was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto), it was also called Hokurei."
"It is the main temple of the Tendai sect of Japan opened by the monk Saisumi (767-822) in the early Heian period."
"The priest is called the Tendaiza lord and presides over the temple."
"Since its inception, it has been the center of Heian Buddhism, along with Koyasan Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of Tendai Hoka, esoteric Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, and Nembutsu were also practiced, giving it the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university, and in the Heian period, it was revered by the imperial family and nobility and had great power."
"In particular, the esoteric prayer of blessings by esoteric Buddhism attracted the support of the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Taimi"" and competed for supremacy against the esoteric Buddhism of Toji (Tōmi) of the Shingon sect."
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a general term for the temple towers of the three towers and sixteen valleys, including the East Tower, the West Tower, and the Yokogawa River, which are scattered in the precincts from the top of Mt. Hiei to the eastern foot."
"It began in the 7th year of the Enki calendar (788) when Saisumi built a soan called Ichijo Shukan-in."
"The temple name Enryakuji, which took the year of its founding, was allowed in the 14th year of Hirohito (824) after the death of Sasumi."
"Enryakuji has produced a number of famous monks, Japan and many of the founders of new Buddhism, such as Ennin, Enchin, the founder of the Harmony Nembutsu Buddha, the founder of the Pure Land Buddhist sect, Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, the founder of the Rinzai sect, the founder of the Rinzai sect, the founder of the Soto sect, and the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, Nichiren, are also called the ""mother mountain of Japan Buddhism"" because many of the founders of new Buddhism and many famous monks in the history of Japan Buddhism practiced on Mt. Hiei in their youth."
"Mt. Hiei also appears in many literary works."
"In addition, rigorous training such as the ""12-year basket mountain trip"" and the ""1,000-day pilgrimage"" has continued to the present day, and it has been registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a representative sacred place of Japan Buddhism."
"Mt. Hiei, whose name can be seen in the Kojiki, is thought to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times, and the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain enshrines the landlord god of Mt. Hiei, Oyama Kojin."
"Sasumi, whose common name is Mitsu Obito Hirono, was born in the 2nd year of Tenpei Jingo (766) in Shiga District, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) (there is also a theory that the year of birth is 767)."
"In the 11th year of Hokame (780), when he was 15 years old, he was ordained under the priest Gyozomo of Omi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Sasumi."
"In the 4th year of Enki (785), when he was 20 years old, he received vows at Todaiji Temple in Nara (to receive the precepts to become an official monk) and became an official monk."
"The young man Sasumi did not seek a stable position at the great temple of Nara, but stayed on Mt. Hiei, close to his hometown, and devoted himself to training and studying scriptures."
"Sasumi considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the best among the many sutras, and studied the ""Three Great Parts of the Lotus Sutra"" (""Dharma Xuanyi"", ""Dharma Phrases"", and ""Magical Views""), which were written by the Chinese Tendai master Chigi."
"In the 7th year of Enki (788), Sasumi built a small temple consisting of Yakushi-do, Bunshu-do, and Kyozo at the location of the current Nemoto Chu-do Hall, and named it Ichijo-shukan-in."
"This temple is also called Hieizan-ji, and it was not until the 14th year of Hirohito (824), after the death of Sasumi, that the temple name ""Enryakuji"" was allowed."
"Emperor Kammu took refuge in Sasumi, and with the assistance of the Emperor and his close aide Waki, Hieizanji Temple gradually flourished as a dojo for the protection of the Onimon (northeast) of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of the Yan Calendar (802), Sasumi was allowed to travel to the Tang Dynasty as a short-term overseas trainee."
"In the 23rd year of the Yan Calendar (804), he went to the Tang Dynasty on a Tang envoy ship."
"Saisumi went to the spiritual land of Mt. Tendai and studied Tendai Buddhism and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from Dozui Kazuhisa, a direct descendant of Tendai Daishi Chigi, and Tendai Buddhism from Gyomanza."
"In addition, at Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), he studied esoteric Buddhism from Shun Xiao Ayori and Zen from Zen master Shakunen."
"In the Kiki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is usually thought to be the god of the night, deifying the moon, but there are different theories (see below)."
"The name is also pronounced Tsukiyomi."
"Since there is a story in the Japan Shoki about slashing and killing the god of food, it is generally considered to be a male god, but there is no depiction in the Kiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often a goddess, and since goddesses with a belligerent personality also appear in many myths of other countries, there are scholars who advocate the goddess theory, saying that the story of the murder of the god of food cannot be an element that determines that it is a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his deity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he escaped from the underworld and cleansed himself, and together with Amaterasu, who was born from the other eye, and Susanoo, who was born from his nose, he formed the three noble children."
"On the other hand, in the Japan Shoki, contrary to the Kojiki, there is a story that it was born from the left eye, and that it was made up of a white copper mirror held in the right hand, and the area of control is not constant, such as the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is paired with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, and it has been pointed out in the field of comparative mythology that various myths have similar ideas."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (The Chronicle of Five Fortunes), there is an origin story that Pangu died and his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon, and in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered to be twins."
"(However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later generations that the two came to be equated.) ）"
"Also, in the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, we are told of the creation of the sun and moon on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and the moon, and made each govern the day and night, separating the light from the darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also thought to follow the pattern of the origin of the sun and moon, which is common throughout the world, in which the sun and moon were born as a pair."
"Although Tsukuyomi is considered an important deity in Japan mythology along with Amaterasu Susanoo, he does not appear much in the mythology of the Kojiki and Japan Shoki, and is generally not active."
"Only in the eleventh book of the fifth dan of the ""Japan Shoki"" the origin of grain is discussed."
"Some believe that this is balanced by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, two gods with contrasting personalities."
"A similar structure can be seen in the Tenno-Onchu chief deity against Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and in Hosseri against Hoori (Yama Yukihiko) and Hoderi (Kaiyukihiko)."
"This is called the hollow structure of Japan mythology."
"Since there is some overlap with Susanoo in terms of dominance and episodes, some advocate the theory of the same god."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he was born when he washed the right eye of Igina, and is called the ""Noble Child of the Three Pillars"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is ordered to ""inform the country of night eating"", but he does not play any further action."
"There is also a theory that it is the land of night watching, where the god Inami is located."
"In the fifth section of the Jindaiki of the Japan Shoki, it is simply stated in the text that ""He gave birth to the god of the moon, who shines second only to the light of the sun, and sent him to heaven to rule alongside the sun,"" but in the first book that follows, it is said that Izanagison gave birth to Dainichi Kōson with a white copper mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to the Tsukiyu Son with a white copper mirror in his right hand."
"As for the area of control, there are several stories of him being instructed to rule the heavens along with Amaterasu, while there is also a story that he was ordered to ""cure the eight hundred folds of the tides of the Canghai Plain"" (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and there are multiple stories of the birth of the three gods."
"In the eleventh book of the 5th Dan of the Shoki, Amaterasu and Tsukiyami are ordered to rule the heavens together, but later Tsukiyami Son, who received orders from Amaterasu to face the Hoshoku God (Ukemochi) in the heavens, descends and goes to the Hoshoku God."
"There is a myth that the god of food served out of his mouth as a feast, so Tsukiyomi was angry that he was ""disrespectful"" and shot the god of food with a sword."
"From the corpses of the god of food, cows and horses, silkworms, and rice were born, which became the origin of grain."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) was one of the official positions belonging to the onmyoji of the Ministry of Central Affairs under the ritsurei system of ancient Japan."
"It refers to a position that was placed as a technique (technician) to perform divination and geological aspects according to the yin-yang way based on the idea of the five elements of yin and yang, and later went beyond the original rules of law to be in charge of divination, magic, and rituals in general."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer to non-official persons who perform divination, magic, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times, it is defined as a type of priesthood that performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It is sometimes pronounced as ""onyoji"" without repeating it."
"The Yin-Yang Five Elements Philosophy, which states that all phenomena are made up of a combination of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements of China, which began in the Shang Dynasty and was almost completed in the Zhou Dynasty, or astronomy, calendars, Yi, clocks, etc., which are closely related to this, were developed in the Asuka period from the 5th to the 6th centuries. At the latest, by the time of 512 (7th year of Emperor Seontai) or 554 (15th year of Emperor Kinmyeong), when Dr. Yi came to Japan from Baekje, it was introduced directly from mainland China (Han and Sui) or via the western region of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje)."
"At first, the influence of these studies on politics and culture was small, but in 602 (the 10th year of Emperor Suiko), Kanrei, who could be said to be a pioneer of the Yin-Yang Way in Japan, came to Japan from Baekje and lectured various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Prince Shotoku, and began to have a great influence on national politics in Japan."
"For the first time, the calendar (Yuan Jia calendar) was adopted as an official calendar in Japan, and in 607 (the 15th year of Emperor Suiko) in order to absorb Buddhism, the Yin-Yang Five Elements Philosophy, and the Calendar Law, the Sui envoys were dispatched to the advanced civilization of Sui, and Prince Shotoku's 17-article constitution and the 12th rank of the crown were also strongly influenced by the Yin-Yang Five Elements Thought."
"Subsequently, the imperial court sent envoys to Sui (later Tang) to accompany foreign students, and invited a large number of monks and scholars from mainland China or from the west coast of the Korean Peninsula to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progressed, it came to be considered important in Japan to ""consider the operation and position of the Sun Moon Star Dragon, judge the auspiciousness of the five elements of thought, judge the good fortune according to the principle of the five elements of aisei and conflict, and obtain guidelines for 100 general human resources"", and the five elements of yin and yang came to be emphasized as a measure to judge good fortune and obtain a code of conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astronomy and had a deep knowledge of the five elements of yin and yang philosophy, established the ""Yin-Yang Dormitory"" and Japan's first astrology platform in 676 (4th year of Emperor Tenmu) during the Jinshin Rebellion."
"In 685 (13th year of Emperor Temmu), the term ""onmyoji"" began to be used, and the idea of the five elements of yin and yang became even more popular, and in 718, the Yoro Ritsu Decree stipulated the establishment of the Yin-Yang Dormitory as a dormitory (ritsuryō system), which is an internal bureau of the Ministry of Central Affairs, and it was stipulated that Astronomical Doctors, Yin-Yang Doctors, Onmyo-ji, Calendar Doctors, and Leaking Doctors would be permanently appointed as engineers. Along with the priest Yong Hou, he was to preside over the ceremony publicly."
"In order to be in charge of the techniques that have been handed down from the continent, each doctor and onmyoji is appointed by a foreigner who is well versed in various studies and is skilled in reading Chinese texts, a monk who came from the Sui dynasty, which took over the continental hegemony in place of the Former Han and Later Han dynasties in mainland China, Goguryeo and Baekje, which had power on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, and in rare cases, monks who came from Silla, which was initially a power on the east coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, in 663 (Cheonchi 2), when Silla unified the Korean Peninsula due to the defeat of the Battle of Baekchon River, where Japan sent reinforcements to Baekje, which was a close country, and the Baekje dynasty collapsed, a large number of intellectuals came from Baekje as exiles, and many of them were appointed."
"At the beginning of the establishment of the Yin-Yang Dormitory, the skills were purely divination, geological aspects (like ""feng shui"" in today's terms), astronomical observation, astrology, creation of calendars, judgment of auspicious days, and omissions, so they were only responsible for astronomical observation, calendar time management, and theoretical analysis of things based on the five elements of yin and yang, and they did not perform any religious rituals or magic like priests or priests. He played an important role in the selection of auspicious days when carrying out repairs at the imperial court, and in the relocation of the capital by divining auspicious fortunes such as land and direction."
"The Structure of the Yin-Yang Dormitory as a Ritsuryō Bureaucracy and the Duties of the Onmyoji"
"In the Yin-Yang dormitory, as an administrative officer who is a clerk,"
"The duties of supervising the Yin-Yang Dormitory, supervising all astronomy, calendars, wind and clouds, and qi colors, and recording and sealing them without leaking them to the outside in the event of an abnormality (astronomical secrets), adjusting the New Year's calendar prepared by Dr. Calendar by November 1 of each year (Imperial Calendar), and performing the results of divination and topography each time."
"The official rank is below the fifth rank."
"Assisted the head of Yin and Yang."
"I inspected the dormitory and managed all the affairs, such as reviewing documents."
"Recorded official documents such as writing and reading aloud."
"He assisted the Yin and Yang family in recording practice."
"As a technician,"
"An instructor who observes the atmosphere of astronomy, seals it so that it does not leak out of the department, and instructs 10 astronomy students who are trainees."
"Astronomy was considered to be the most difficult of the Yin and Yang Paths, so it was set higher than the other doctors."
"An instructor who instructs 10 Yin-Yang students."
"It is set as high as the Doctor of Astronomy."
