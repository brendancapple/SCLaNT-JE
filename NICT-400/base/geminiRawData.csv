The Doshisha is a school corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha is a comprehensive school founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, based on the Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) faith. It comprises nine educational institutions under the name ""Doshisha,"" ranging from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 people were studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University, a private school corporation, holds an <AA+> rating from the Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating on a 21-level scale.
"It is among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Josiah Conder envisioned the cultivation of individuals who ""apply conscience to practical skills"" as the educational objective."
"We aspire to educate individuals whose hearts are filled with conscience, by implementing a ""virtue education"" based on Christian values alongside knowledge-based education, ensuring a balanced development."
"Monuments inscribed with his thoughts, in his own handwriting, can be found at Doshisha University and other schools."
"This monument of conscience is inscribed with the words, ""May there arise men of strong character whose conscience pervades their whole being."""
"Furthermore, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" have been put forward as concrete ways to realize this ""conscience"" education, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation."""
"It is a Christian Protestant school corporation, following the tradition of the Congregational church."
"However, unlike so-called mission schools, it does not aim primarily at Christian evangelization (it does not use education as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, established in 1875 by Jōshīma Jō, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded the Doshisha English School in Kyoto's Teramachi-dori, Marutamachi."
Moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa in 1876.
"Doshisha Branch School for Women was established in April 1877, and renamed Doshisha Girls' School in September."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"For ""Ikkyu-san's Anecdotes of Wisdom"", see the entry for ""Ikkyu-doku"" (this page also contains a brief description). For the television anime ""Ikkyu-san"", see the entry for ""Ikkyu-san""."
"Born in Kyoto, said to be a child of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"According to a secret tradition, Ikkyū Sōjun was the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He later became known as Zhou Jian, and used the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kaltro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshun, which can also be written as Soshun."
Ikyu is a Dharma name.
"(Please refer to the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgai Shūkan of Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, being given the name Zhou Jian."
"He was gifted with poetic talent from an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained acclaim and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Kenō Sōi and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
He became a disciple of the high priest Kaso Sodun at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Ōei era).
"The Zen master, Hakuin, bestowed the monastic name Ikkyu upon the monk who answered the koan, ""The Three Bites of Donzan's Staff,"" with, ""From the presence of the self to the absence of the self, returning, a moment's rest, if rain falls, let it fall, if wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Nāo ""Yūroji"" (Yūroji)"" refers to the world of delusion (bonnō), while ""Muroji"" (Muroji) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in the year 1420, a raven's cry awakened him to sudden enlightenment."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"He sent Hua-sou away, laughing, calling him a fool."
"Afterward, he lived a life of poetry, kyoka (comic poetry), calligraphy and painting, and eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died childless, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was welcomed and ascended the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Goshū to the throne.
"From the ""Chronological Biography of Ikkyū Zenji of the East Sea""."
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi maintains that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's consent and that Ikkū's recommendation had no bearing on it."
"In the sixth year of Bunmei (1474), after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the 47th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple by Imperial decree from Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. While he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its reconstruction."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle) was preserved in 1877, as the Emperor moved there following the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the Inner Palace, near the center of the city. However, due to wars and other troubles, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Court moved to the Satō-no-uchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Imperial Palace was one of the Inner Palaces in this area, and was the residence of successive emperors of the Jimyoin line, who later became known as the Northern Court."
"The imperial palace of the Daikakuji line of emperors, who would later be known as the Southern Court, was located in the Nijō Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace, but rather an expanded version of it."
"Normally, attendance requires an application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive Emperors until the Emperor moved to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace today (in the 21st century) is state property and is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the adjacent Imadegawa Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"It is noteworthy that, unlike overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not particularly high. Some suggest this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity that ordinary people have with their rulers (the Emperor and other Imperial family members) in the East versus the West."
"For example, the fact that events like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch during the French Revolution, by commoners have not occurred in Japan is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a position northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the ""Sato-no-Uchi,"" known as the ""Tsuchimikado Higashi no Toin dono,"" and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was rebuilt in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the style of the Heian period."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, he lamented the dilapidated state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair just ten years after his move to Tokyo. He ordered its preservation and the maintenance of its original appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Oszumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seishinden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijōsai (Great Harvest Festival) be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specifically designate Kyoto as the location for the ceremony. In 1990, on the occasion of the enthronement of the present Emperor, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the official throne where the Emperor sits during the enthronement ceremony and where his ascension is symbolically represented, is located in the Shishinden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi""), the throne was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a simple wooden structure, gable roof, and cypress bark roof, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public events."
"The two flanking earthen walls each have five horizontal lines, which is the highest form of formality for a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon Gate, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This paper focuses on Japanese gagaku (an Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down within the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" the counterpart to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency's Bureau of Ceremonies and Music, the term ""Japanese music"" refers to all music performed by the Bureau, excluding Western music."
Much of it survives as instrumental music in courtly circles.
It is the oldest form of traditional music in the world to still be performed in large ensembles.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form, Gagaku was discontinued for over 100 years after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered the descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable to what extent it retains the form of the Heian period."
"It is inferred that the piece, written in katakana notation for the hichiriki, is sung with a faithful rendition, including the pronunciation of the ""h"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo"" characteristic of pre-16th century Japanese, suggesting a high degree of accuracy in its overall recreation."
"The notation used in *Gakubiwa* music, written in Chinese characters, shares many similarities with the *pipa* music scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, suggesting a strong inheritance of an even older, continental style."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) who lamented the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) during the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakusha compiled records of Gagaku and Bugaku, primarily focused on the shō, providing valuable documentation of early-era Gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music that came from China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, the Tang music played in Japanese gagaku today is said to be based on the music played at banquets in the Tang dynasty, known as Yanle."
"Even in terms of music categories, names like Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music) are found, reflecting a diverse international character.  These categories also incorporate elements of ancient Japanese music predating the transmission of music from the continent."
"Before the modern era, the Tenoju-gakujo of Shitennouji Temple (Osaka), the Dai-naigakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto-gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were known as the Sanpo-gakujo, representing the oldest styles of music."
"These musical institutions, while later consolidated in Tokyo during the modern period and becoming the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, continue to maintain their individual traditions in their respective locations."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 songs are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics reference S-country's traditional song and dance.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-Yi (Southern Vietnam) influences."
"Right-hand dance, Koryo music... Korean, Balhae (Northeastern China) origins."
These include songs produced in Japan (Honkagaku) that imitate the above style.
Songs from the Heian period (Utaimono)
The lyrics reference a song.
"Sometimes, Kokufu Kabuki and Yōkyoku are collectively referred to as Ancient Japanese Music."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737 AD, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Konin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that the mother of Takano no Niigasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing their lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Ando (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinriga, was of lowly origin, a naturalized clan from the Wa clan. Therefore, he was not expected to become Crown Prince and initially aimed for a career as an official, serving as a Chamberlain, Grand Master of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were suddenly deposed, and he was declared Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Fearful of the growing influence of the Buddhist temples in Nara, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, in 784, the city of Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794, the city of Heian-kyo was built anew."
"They then sent an army led by Sakanoe no Tamuramaro, as the Great General of the Conquest, to invade the Tohoku region and subdue the Ezo."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Otsugu of the Fujiwara clan for the military and construction projects that were causing hardship to the peasantry."
He is credited with conceiving the compilation of the Chronicle of Japan.
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marked by the unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Princess Todo, as well as the exile and subsequent death in 785 of Prince Sawayara, the emperor's younger brother, who had been designated as crown prince. Prince Sawayara was banished due to accusations of involvement in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, casting a dark shadow over the early years of the emperor's rule."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's grave was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was reinstated as Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" confiscating their estates and other forms of pressure, as they had become too entangled with the government and amassed too much power."
"The harem's chaotic state was also a matter of public discussion, providing fertile ground for the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17, 806."
He was given the posthumous title of Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi-i-yaderi-no-Mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style posthumous title of Emperor Kanmu.
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku Ossuhabari no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"Though he had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
"After the Meiji Restoration, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined in Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in a customary press conference, mentioned in his comments regarding the upcoming FIFA World Cup co-hosted the following year, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea, as it is recorded in the Shoku Nihongi that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive significant coverage in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of discussion in South Korean media."
"Some reports have gone so far as to claim the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and promote the theory of ""Kudara origins of the Imperial Family,"" making significant leaps in logic."
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism and the hereditary head (Hoshū) of the Honganji temple, the largest sect of Jodo Shinshu."
"Both the chief priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the Jodo Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hombyo), which separated in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji era."
The origin of the surname Ōtani is derived from the location of Shinran's mausoleum in the Ōtani area north of the main gate of Chion-in Temple in eastern Kyoto.
"During the Sengoku period (Japan), Hongan-ji Temple held a power comparable to that of warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement. As a result, it is sometimes counted as one of the Sengoku daimyō, and the temple's chief priest is often referred to by his Dharma name (Jōdo Shinshū) or given name with the term ""Hongan-ji"" as a prefix, such as ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" or ""Hongan-ji Kōsa."" However, this is purely for convenience in naming. The Hongan-ji Temple chief priest lineage never adopted ""Hongan-ji"" as their family name, nor did a ""Hongan-ji"" family exist."
"Jaku Shin Ni, a Buddhist nun, attended to the deathbed of Shinran in 1262 and built a hall to enshrine his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, serving as the mausoleum of Shinran, became the revered Ootani Temple for Jodo Shinshu followers.  Kakukei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, was entrusted with its management as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani temple attracted pilgrims and donations from various provinces, leading to a dispute over the absentee office between Kakunyo, the son of Kake, and  Taisen, Kake's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary nature of the absentee office by his lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the imperial palace into a temple, marking the birth of the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Honganji temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, progressed in forming a religious organization. During the Muromachi period, under the 5th generation leader Shakuni, the temple expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the 7th generation leader Jonyo, the Honganji religious organization had been established in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working to establish their own institutions since the death of Shinran, the establishment of the Honganji Temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a subordinate temple of the Shoren-in Temple. The Otani family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's family), also served as a kind of steward for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Hongan-ji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Hongan-ji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province, and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding influence of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and resulting in a situation described as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was virtually ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Hongan-ji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai of various ranks, grew increasingly active across Japan. However, the Yamashina Hongan-ji temple was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon-Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest,  Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Go-bo, a temple founded by Rennyo in Nishiarima County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as the Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the summit of the hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Terrace.
"It controlled Osaka, the key transportation hub at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shōnyo strengthened the temple's power base by forging close relationships with various daimyō, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some in the Honganji sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central control of Honganji Temple and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Hongan-ji sect had effectively become an independent daimyo power. It clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who aimed to unify the Kinai region by taking over territorial authority from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji gain the upper hand due to the combined efforts of Kannon, who held the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the Honganji followers who staged resistance movements against the Oda clan throughout the land. This significantly challenged Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, which had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed. This suppressed resistance in various areas. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, suffered a naval defeat at the Battle of Kizu River against the Oda navy. This marked a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own territory."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple continued to retain its strength with the support of groups like the Saika-shu, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, finally succumbing to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, it abandoned Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple, marking the end of Hongan-ji Temple as a territorial power."
"At this time, the eldest son, Kyonyo, who argued for continued resistance against the wishes of Kennyo, caused a rift between them. When Kennyo passed away in 1593, the third son, Junnyo, succeeded him."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of its chief priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the East Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyo'nyo."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyojo's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, resulting in the division of the Honganji into east and west."
"Both the Eastern and Western Otani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a tradition of successive heads being adopted by powerful court nobles. Moreover, they have continuously intermarried with court families for generations, resulting in a progressive increase in their court-like nature through their maternal lineage."
Kyoutanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Idecho, Tsuzuki District, Seika Town, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, making it the central point of the triangular region encompassing the three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains to the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are strongly characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), city status was granted, formerly Tsukiyo-gun, Tanabe-cho."
"It was established as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"On the same day, the town of Tanabe in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was elevated to city status (municipal implementation) as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City,"" with the prefix ""Kyo"" from Kyoto Prefecture added to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, and the city's name was changed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Moreover, the new city name was chosen through public nomination."
It is renowned for its tea (Uji tea) cultivation and boasts Gyokuro as a specialty product.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operations in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008 - Bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamaki-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Adjacent Itecho, Tsuzki District is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to a National Treasure eleven-faced standing Kannon statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyu and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the central stations for the Kyotanabe city center, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is also served by ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line.
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city's name around the time of its municipal incorporation.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While the station in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, is called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Main Line), the inclusion of ""Kii,"" the former province of Wakayama, in the station's name is likely to avoid duplication with other stations in the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Branch is located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Branch is located within the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces of the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the region encompassing present-day Saitama and Tokyo east of the Sumida River, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including present-day Kawasaki City and eastern/coastal Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki: Provincial Governor's rank classification, remote province."
"Heian-kyo, established in 794 AD (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō was a city built in the area spanning across Kamo County and Atago County in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the center of Kyoto City in present-day Kyoto Prefecture. It was a rectangular city with dimensions of 4.5 km east-west and 5.2 km north-south."
"The Imperial Palace was established in the center of the northernmost part of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue leading from it to the heart of the city, dividing the city into the Left Capital (east) and the Right Capital (west)."
"The floor plan is essentially based on Heijokyo, following the pattern of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony,"" derived from the Chinese practice of Feng Shui."
The extent of Heian-kyō was smaller than the current city of Kyoto.
"The northernmost major street, Ichijo-dori, is located between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Southern Limit of the Nine Streets is currently the Kujō-dori Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
"Tokyo's easternmost thoroughfare, Higashi-Gyo, corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori."
"The estimated location of Saikyo-ku Oji, the westernmost limit, is a line running north-south connecting Hanazono Station on the West Japan Railway Sanyo Main Line (Kyoto Prefecture) and Saikyo-ku Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line."
"The capital was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by large and small streets running north-south, east-west."
"A ""条"" is a collection of four rows of towns aligned east-west, excluding the two rows on the northern border.  A ""坊"" is a collection of four columns of towns aligned north-south."
The 16 towns belonging to the same district were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho."""
"The width of roads was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for narrow lanes, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for main roads."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters).
"Moreover, the Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji were paralleled by rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishi Horikawa River)."
Emperor Kanmu established the capital at Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to establish a new capital by Emperor Tenji's lineage, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting Emperor Tenmu's lineage was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent deposition of Prince Sayo, and the slow progress in the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded with the construction of the city itself.
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a marshland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), and therefore remained undeveloped even in the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely defunct, the capital was so desolate that farmland, which was originally prohibited within its boundaries, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"Noble residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"Nihon Koki is a history book compiled in the early Heian period, commissioned by the imperial court, and the third of the Six National Histories, following Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records a period of 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
The editors are Fujiwara Osamu et al.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of the Kōnin era (819 AD), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryōzen no Yasushi to compile this work."
"The remaining three, excluding Prince Otsugu, died without completing the task, so later Emperor Junwa issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Prince Naoyoshi, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Ima-tsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further edicts were issued, entrusting Fujiwara Tsugushi, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori with their execution."
"Later, after adding Furutaka Niwa and Yamada Koji, they finally reported its completion on December 9th of the 7th year of Jōwa (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation, which took 21 years, was a project spanning three reigns, and Fujiwara no Otsugu was the sole individual involved throughout."
"It continues the account of the ""Chronicles of Japan"" and covers the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, beginning mid-way through the reign of Emperor Kanmu."
"It consisted of forty volumes until the early 15th century, but then became scattered.  Later, Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of  Hanawa Hokiichi, discovered ten volumes in a copy at the Sanjo-nishi family (although there is a different theory that it was discovered in a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu) and published them for the first time."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes, with the reign of Emperor Junna completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the *Nihon Kiryaku*, an abridged version of the Six National Histories, and the *Ruijū Kokushi*, a classified index of the Six National Histories, by citing passages from both sources."
"There are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun,"" which are collections of various historical anecdotes. Based on these, the following have been published by Shueisha's annotated Japanese historical materials and Kodansha Academic Library."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinion of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The inclusion of brief biographies (kōden) in the obituaries of emperors and courtiers followed the precedent set by the ""Shoku Nihongi"" and was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the account of his death in this book does not simply fall into the usual pattern of one-sided, official praise or condemnation. Instead, it includes many interesting descriptions interspersed with unique critiques and observations, making it a remarkable exception among the Six National Histories for its persistence of a critical spirit."
"It is also known that the ""Six National Histories"" included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical works."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There are also accounts that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), a renowned poet and one of the ""Five of the Pear-Jar."""
"There is an ancient tradition that identifies ""檜垣嫗 (Higaki no Ōna)"" in the ""後撰和歌集 (Goshūi Wakashū)"" as your mother, but this is nothing more than a far-fetched and absurd theory."
"My great-grandfather (or possibly my grandfather) was Ki no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"Among his siblings are the Head of Gagaku, Tameari; the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Chichimori; the Buddhist priest Kaiju, who was a retainer of the Flower Mountain Palace; and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yoshinobu, the brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother."
"Sei Shōnagon's name, a lady-in-waiting, is said to be derived from her family name, Kiyohara, and the title of a relative, ""Shōnagon."""
"The real name is unknown. There is a theory (""The Pillow Book"") that it was ""Nagiko,"" but it is unreliable."
"Counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she left behind a small collection of 42 poems, known as the ""Sei Shonagon Collection"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most common version has 31)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate."
"Her mother was Keishu-in, daughter of Konoe Nobutada."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his brother."
"He had initially been a monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the aid of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"And, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, he ascended to Kyoto and became the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an encirclement with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to surround him."
"Although he had once cornered Nobunaga, the shogun was eventually expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, effectively ending the Muromachi Shogunate."
He then spent the rest of his life with the assistance of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born November 13, 1537, the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijo-in Temple of Kofukuji) as a foster son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, the abbot of Rokuon-in, Ashikaga Shuketsu, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsu permanent Hidehisa and others, and confined to the Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hidehisa and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakeyo, since Kakeyo was the younger brother of the Shogun, and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple's Abbot in the future.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and, it is said, was attacked by thieves at night and even called ""the impoverished Shogun""."
He was secretly promoted to the rank of Jugoi-ge and appointed as Sama no Kami on April 21st.
"However, while there are questions about the exact date of his appointment, Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu-kyoki"" records that on February of Eiroku 11 (1568), the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Yoshiie Ashikaga, Yoshiaki's rival, Tokitsugu, who was the envoy for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's envoy visited his residence and requested his mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushiinoge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku father and son, Yoshikata and Yoshiharu, in Ōmi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Goodes, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshitaka of Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, due to internal strife and power struggles among their senior vassals, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to the capital.  In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and sought his aid in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, of the Ashikaga Shogunate branch line, at ""Kuradani Gosho,"" and was not interested in actively going up to Kyoto with the newly-returned to secular life Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the plan to go up to Kyoto never materialized."
"The ceremony of capping was conducted by Asakura Yoshikage. (Note: There is no historical record of Yoshiaki formally coming of age at this time, making his late adulthood ceremony highly unusual.)"
"He later moved to Mino Province, seeking the patronage of Oda Nobunaga, through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a high-ranking official of the Asakura clan."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
He was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court on October 18th.
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Jushi-no-ge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed to the posts of Sangi (Councilor), and Sakon'e no Gon-chūjō (Assistant Commander of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard)."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both of which connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the name ""JR"" is added to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■) and, along with the JR Kobe Line, it is positioned as a main line of the company, so the corporate color itself is directly used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes at a maximum speed of 130 km/h, running along the right bank of the Yodo River parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line, covering a distance of 42.8 km."
It is a quadruple-track line with separate quadruple-track sections for each direction (outer and inner tracks).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Tokai's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with a Sanyo Line operation management system.
It is operated jointly with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line features express trains, rapid trains, local trains (Kyoto-Hanshin Local Line), all of which run through to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as limited express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of all local trains extend their service to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"The JR restructuring led to a significant increase in express train frequency on the Kyoto route, with new through services from Osaka to Kyushu overnight trains, from Tennoji to the Kii Peninsula, and the Hakuto service to the San-in region, which started with the opening of the Chizu Express Line."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later. The New Osaka-Kyoto line became a ""special expressway,"" with about four express trains running per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Raicho"" and other trains."
"However, all sleeper trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued in the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line depart from the third platform at Ibaraki Station, enter the freight line, and proceed to Shin-Osaka via the Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the journey takes slightly longer than express trains or rapid trains on the outer lines for the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, and the outer tracks can handle speeds of 130 km/h except for some curved sections."
"While the inner track can accommodate trains running at 120 km/h, express trains never use it (though it is used by empty trains or temporary trains)."
The express trains operating on this section are as follows:
"In addition, freight trains such as ""Hamakaze"", ""Tanba"", and ""Hokkin-ki"" run on this section in relation to their arrival and departure from Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" express trains between Mukomachi and Osaka run on the Hokubu Freight Line during shunting operations."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto Comprehensive Depot, it proceeds down from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west, and then merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, when running for loading and unloading, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs direct from JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Line Amagasaki, Joge, and Ako Line Banshu Ako to JR Kyoto Line, then on to the Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one midday service to the Kusatsu Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains operate using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, in 8 or 12-car formations."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, a 100km-long high-standard expressway (National Route 478), runs from Kumoyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, this road strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, promotes regional revitalization, and serves as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Kyoto Governor refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the middle, and the ending point. The starting point opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, it is often the case that the term ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway"" refers solely to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as part of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway."
"Furthermore, the section from Kuze-Yodoyachi IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc., is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll Road Sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There are currently no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer/autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the corporation, resulting in the current free section, Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT, becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new toll booth, Ayabe Angokuji, will be established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC does not have a toll booth. This will eliminate all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is constructed like a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanba Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with a planned opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after its opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: General National Route 9 Oinonozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was changed from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection with the Maizuru Expressway (current: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) opened with the opening of the Ayabe JCT - Maizuru Ooe IC (temporary 2-lane, opposite direction traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations involved in roads were privatized, with their assets transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and their management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The background color of the IC Number column is ■ for sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamotohonmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompassing the entire Mount Hiei, which has an elevation of 848 meters."
"It is often called Mount Hiei, or Eizan, rather than by its formal name, Enryaku-ji Temple."
It was located north of Heian-kyō (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (kanju) is called Tendai Zasho and oversees the branch temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple."
"It practiced the teachings of the Lotus Sutra of the Tendai sect, along with esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land Buddhism, presenting an image of a comprehensive Buddhist university.  During the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial Family and nobility, and wielded great power."
"In particular, esoteric practices and prayers attracted the support of Heian nobles, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Taimitsu"" in contrast to the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple of the Shingon sect (""Tomitsu""), and the two competed for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji is a collective term for the numerous temples and structures of the three towers and sixteen valleys scattered across the mountainside of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills."
"It began in the year 788, when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Jikan-in."
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which takes its name from the year of its founding, was only granted in 824, the 14th year of the弘仁 era, after the death of Saicho."
"Enryaku-ji Temple, known as the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism,"" has produced numerous renowned monks and served as the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism.  Among its notable figures are Ennin, Enchin, who established the basis of Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu,  Hōnen, the founder of Jōdo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jōdo Shinshū, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dōgen, the founder of Sōtō Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism.  Many prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history, including the founders of new Buddhist sects, honed their skills on Mount Hiei in their youth."
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training practices such as the ""12 Years of Mountain Retreat"" and the ""Thousand Days of Peak Pilgrimage"" continue to this day. As a prominent sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List."
"Mount Hiei is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"" (Records of Ancient Matters), and it is believed to have been a mountain of Shinto mountain worship since ancient times.  The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyama-tsumi no kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained as a monk by Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the 4th year of the Enryaku era (785), he was ordained as a monk at Todai-ji Temple in Nara."
"The young Saicho, driven by a strong conviction, chose to forgo a secure position in a prominent Nara temple and instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, close to his homeland, devoting himself to rigorous training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Words of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Concentration and Insight"") by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788 AD, Saicho established a small temple consisting of Yakushi-do, Monju-do, and a Sutra repository at the present location of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Jikan-in."
"This temple is also called Hieizan-ji, and it was only after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the Koonin era (824), that it was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which incorporates an era name."
"Emperor Kanmu, during his reign, became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually prospered as a national sanctuary guarding the demon gate (northeast) of Kyoto."
"In 802 AD, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a ""Gengakushō"" (a short-term overseas trainee)."
He traveled to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804.
"Saicho went to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai Buddhism and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and Tendai Buddhism from the abbot Gyōman."
"Furthermore, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from Shunkyo Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing)."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"The moon is generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, though there are alternative theories (discussed below)."
"The name is also read as ""Tsukiyomi""."
"The Kojiki recounts the slaying of Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of this deity as male, although the texts themselves lack any definitive gender-identifying descriptions."
"In many other mythologies, the moon deity is often a goddess, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the fact that the god who killed the food goddess is male does not necessarily prove that he is a male god, and thus support the theory that the god is female."
"Tsukiyomi, considered the moon god, has various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the three noble deities."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" unlike the ""Kojiki,"" there are accounts of the deity being born from the left eye, and emerging from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The deity's domain of control also varies, including heaven, sea, and other inconsistent locations."
"Tsukiyomi, born in contrast to Amaterasu who symbolizes the sun, is a concept found in various mythologies, as comparative mythology points out."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon after his death, while in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification only occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, it is said that on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the heavens, namely the sun and the moon, and appointed them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, as well, can be considered to follow the pattern of sun-moon origin myths common throughout the world, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a significant deity in Japanese mythology, alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, Tsukuyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall actions are rather limited."
"Only in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki"" is there a brief mention of the origin of grain."
"There is also a theory that this is balanced by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, who have contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in other examples such as Amenominakanushi no kami in relation to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri in relation to Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [another deity] are the same deity, citing overlapping domains and episodes."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity was born when Izanagi washed his right eye. They are known as the ""Three Noble Children,"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""announce the land of the night's food,"" but his subsequent activities are never recorded."
There is also a theory that Izanami is in the land of Yomi.
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki's divine age, the text simply states that the deity of the moon, radiating a brilliance second only to the sun's light, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book, which follows, states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Ōhirume no Mikoto, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukoyomi no Mikoto."
"While there are several narratives where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside a deity, there is also a story where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" seemingly stemming from the idea that the moon controls tides. These multiple narratives of the birth of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the fifth chapter, the eleventh book of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. However, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was later ordered by Amaterasu to meet with Ukemochi, the Food Deity, in the heavens. He descended and went to Ukemochi."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, in a gesture of hospitality, spat out rice from her mouth, and Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto, angered by this act of ""impurity,"" killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the food deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, and these became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji is a title for an official who belonged to the Onmyoryo, a department of the Ministry of Central Affairs, under the Ritsuryo system of ancient Japan."
"An official position, originally assigned to practitioners of divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, later expanding beyond the original legal framework to oversee all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"Since the medieval period, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practice divination, sorcery, and ritual ceremonies privately in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who engages in private prayer and divination."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'youji"" without linking the sounds."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, originating in the ancient Chinese Xia and Shang dynasties and largely complete by the Zhou dynasty, which postulates that all phenomena are formed by combinations of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendar, Yi Jing, and timekeeping, were transmitted directly from the Chinese mainland (Han-Sui dynasties) or indirectly via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo-Baekje) by the 5th-6th centuries, during the Asuka period in Japan, no later than 512 AD (7th year of Emperor Keitai) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (15th year of Emperor Kinmei) when Yi Jing scholars arrived."
"Although the initial influence of these studies on politics and culture was minimal, the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje in 602 (the tenth year of Empress Suiko's reign), who became the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, marked a significant turning point. He lectured these studies to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, which significantly impacted the nation's governance."
"The first adoption of a calendar (Genka Calendar) as the official calendar in Japan, along with the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign) to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendrical knowledge, marked a significant influence of these ideas on the subsequent development of Japanese culture. This influence is evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution and the twelve-rank system of court ranks attributed to Prince Shotoku."
"Afterwards, the court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (and later Tang), and also invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the west coast of the Korean peninsula, where the ships would stop, to further acquire knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed, in Japan it came to be considered important to ""understand the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, interpret good and bad fortune based on the principles of the five elements (五行) of mutual generation and mutual overcoming, and thereby predict the future and obtain guidance for all aspects of human affairs.""  As a result, Yin Yang and Five Elements theory gained significance as a means of determining good fortune, bad fortune, and establishing behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of celestial divination and deeply knowledgeable in Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, established the ""Yin-Yang Office"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of his reign), demonstrating his mastery of the art by personally using the shi (divination board) during the Jinshin War."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), and the Yin-Yang Five Elements theory became even more prevalent. In 718, the Yōrō Code formally established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Onmyōji masters, calendrical experts, and clock-makers, placing it alongside the Shinto shrine's divination practices as the official body for divination."
"Only those skilled in techniques transmitted from the continent were appointed as doctors and Onmyoji. They were mostly immigrants proficient in various academic fields and skilled in reading classical Chinese, including those who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui Dynasty, which had replaced them as the dominant force on the continent, Goguryeo and Baekje, which held power on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally Silla, which had initially been a power in the east of the Korean peninsula."
"Especially after the Battle of Baekgang, in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), where Japan sent an expeditionary force to aid Baekje, their close ally, but suffered defeat and Silla unified the Korean peninsula, resulting in the fall of the Baekje dynasty, a large number of intellectuals fled from Baekje and arrived in Japan as refugees. Among them, many were appointed to official positions."
"In its early stages, the Yin Yang Liao's expertise was purely limited to divination, geomancy (similar to modern ""Feng Shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the use of clepsydras. Therefore, their activities were primarily focused on astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on the Yin Yang Five Elements theory.  They did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the court, determining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and directions, and advising on relocation decisions, particularly during the relocation of the capital."

"The duties of the office include overseeing the Yin Yang Office, supervising all aspects of astronomy, calendar, weather, and signs, recording and sealing any anomalies without leaking them to the outside, and making secret submissions to the Emperor (astronomical secret submissions) in cases of such occurrences.  Furthermore, they are responsible for submitting the new year calendar created by the calendar doctor by November 1st each year (imperial calendar submission), as well as submitting the results of divination and geomancy as needed."
