I was born in Kyoto and I am said to be a descendant of Emperor Gosuzaku.
"According to the secret legend, Ikkyu Sōjun is the illegitimate royal child of Gofumonin."
"""There is no one in this world who knows him."""
"His childhood name was, according to later historical materials, Senkichimaru."
"He was referred to by the name Zhou Jian as name grew recognized, and he used aliases such as Kuang Yunzi, Xa Lu, and Mu Kei."
"The posthumous name is Soshun, also written as Soshun."

"He demonstrated exceptional poetic talent from an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Changan Spring Grass"" written at age 13, and ""Spring Clothes Stay Overnight with Flowers"" written at age 15, garnered great admiration and praise in Luoyang."
"In the 17th year of Ōei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Kenō Sōi and changed his Buddhist name to Sōjun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether this is due to a change in his teacher, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of Oei (1415), he became a disciple of Kaso Sodon, a high-ranking monk of Daikaku-ji in Kyoto."
"He received the novice name ""Ikkyu"" from Hossō, after he answered the Munchō of Dōzan Sando saying: ""From no-being results being, taking a res nude, lining realize the giver depressing wrapproof gather's weights shitty decide it prices colossal dragon tagging strange decided wastilities poetry impaired slipking Nut-Brown all-sky."""
"""Also, 'aroru' (world of defilements) refers to the world of delusions (attachments), and 'uraugu' (world of enlightenment) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."""
"One night in the 27th year of ܧuvei ٧ uprising (1420), suddenly realize deeply upon hearing the crows' cries."
The old man tried to give him the permit but Ikkyu refused.
It is said that theere senile men laughed at the fools98 and sent them off.
"Afterwards, he led a life of poetry, mad songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In 1428 (the first year of Shōchō), Emperor Shōkō passed away without leaving any sons, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Zen Master Mumon Ekai."""
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono Emperor was supported by the shogunate and has nothing to do with Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era (1474), after the Ōnin War, I was appointed as the abbot of Daitokuji Temple by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. Although I did not live at the temple, I devoted myself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo procession of the Meiji restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle) and was preserved until 1877, the 10th year of the Meiji era."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been called the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the formal imperial residence in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of the capital, but it was moved to the residence within the capital due to wars and upheavals."
"Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in Nerita was one of the imperial residences in this capital city where the emperors of the Jomyo-in dynasty, later known as the Northern Court, resided."
"Incidentally, the imperial palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which will be called the Minami-gyō, was located within the Niijōtōtsukōji."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashiidoin, but it has been expanded based on the Tsuchimikado Higashii-doin ini."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence / office of the successive emperors until the Meiji Restoration in 1869.
"The current (21st century) Kyoto Imperial Palace is state-owned property and classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sent superb Palace, and across the street to the north is Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's University (both campuses on Imadegawa Street)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Kamigyo Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Imperial Garden, a national park surrounding these palaces."
"Kyoto residents often simply call it the ""Palace"", also including the Kyoto Gyoen."
"In contrast to overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. One theory suggests that this difference is indicative of the varying levels of familiarity between the ruling class (emperors and the imperial family in Japan) and the common people in the East and the West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners infiltrated the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the rulers (king). This is one of the reasons why such incidents have not occurred in Japan based on this analysis."
"In the beginning, the Imperial  Palace of Heian-kyō was located much farther west from the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at a position northeast of the Senbon Maruta-machi intersection near JR Nijo Station in Kyoto, Japan."
"The existing Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the Rokuhara Tandai, called the Tsuchimikado Higashifurinomiya, which was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the year 1331."
"The Inner Palace that was here has been rebuilt eight times in the Edo period alone (six of them were rebuilt due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in the second year of Ansei in the late Edo period (1855) in the Heian style and is called the Ansei Inner Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its original appearance."
"Main buildings include Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Ozusumisho, and Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Kyoto Imperial Palace in the Shishinden Hall for generations. Even after the Emperor relocated to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, it was stipulated by the 1889 Imperial Household Law that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijōsai ceremony must be conducted in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also held their enthronement rituals at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there is no particular regulation on the location for conducting ceremonies in Kyoto in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II. For the ascension of the reigning Emperor to the throne in 1990, for the first time in history, the Ceremony of Ascension was held in the Seiden Hall of the Tokyo Imperial Palace."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor is seated on the Takamikura, the official throne symbolizing the Emperor's reign, which is located in the Shishinden Hall at the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokui no Rei"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
"Suki, kirizuma built, hikidabuki, with a pillar spacing of one ken."
"The gate is opened only for special events such as the visit of the Emperor, dignitaries, foreign guests, or public opening."
"In the left and right Tsujibeis, there are five lines (horizontal lines) included, which also indicate the highest possible format of a fence."
"Upon passing through this gate and the red-tiled glazed Shouming Gate, the main building that comes into view is the Hall of Supreme Clarity."
"Gagaku is a traditional music form of Japan, China, Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
"The following describes Japanese gagaku handed down at the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency, highlighting its significance as an important intangible cultural asset."
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and proper music and dance,"" the opposite of ""vulgar music."""
"As defined by the Kokugai Mydaicho Buyokuren association, it specifically excludes Western music compositions to refer to the works performed by the buyo (dance) section musicians at the Imperial Household Agency."
Much of it has been passed down as court music in instrumental compositions.
It is the world's oldest form of traditional music still performed in large-scale ensemble style.
"However, as a form of ensemble Gagaku, it had been interrupted for more than 100 years since the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate collected the descendants of musicians (Gagaku) and reorganized it, so it is questionable how much of the form of the Heian period has been inherited."
"When singing a score written in katakana for the biwa, adding rhythm to the characters in the score to sing it as a incantation melody, such as pronouncing the 'ha' line as 'fa-fi-fu-fe-fo,' faithfully preserving 16th century Japanese pronunciation features as a whole, making it possible to accurately reproduce the ancient singing style for the biwa."
"Things that are written in Chinese characters like Gakubiwa's score have many similarities to the Biwa scores found in Dunhuang, China, and many styles that have been passed down from an even older continent are inherited."
"One of the most important historical sources is the ""Taigen Shou"" (Compendium of Ikuta), written by Toyohara Takemasa (1450-1512), who was concerned about the loss of records of ancient court music due to the Ōnin War."

"Ceremonial music originating from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century formed the basis."
"When we talk about ya-yüe in China, we are referring to music performed during rituals."
"However, among the music currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music transmitted from China is said to be based on music played at the Tang banquet called Yan music."
"Categories of songs such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linhỏ̂i music (Champa's music) have rich international names, containing elements of traditional Japanese music from before the arrival of continental music."
"Before modern times, the Gakuso of Shitennoji Temple in Tennoji (Osaka), the Daigakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major imperial music halls that carried on the oldest styles."
"As modernity arrived, these entertainment districts were called to Tokyo and formed the foundation of the imperial music department that exists today. The traditions of each entertainment district continue in their respective regions."
"In addition to meio and statement genres, there has been mutual influence between folk songs.s/styles that unique to Japan have been created."
"Currently, about 100 pieces have been passed down to the Music Department of the Board of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household Agency."
Refer to the lyrics of the S country-style traditional dance.
There is a view that only items that have been transmitted from outside Japan should be considered as gagaku.
"Zufang Dance Tang Music ... China, India, and Lin Yiyu (Southern Vietnam)"
"Right-dance music Korean…Korean, Bohai (Northeast region of China)."
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above style (Japanese music) as well.
Songs created in the Heian period (utaimono)
The lyrics are a reference to a well-known song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances are collectively referred to as ancient songs and thatch plays.

"However, due to political struggles involving the Fujiwara clan and others, former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Fujiwara Inoue, were suddenly removed from their positions and Crowned Prince first apperad at January 21 in Hoki 4 (773)."

"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built anew."
"Once again, a army was sent to invade the Tohoku region and bring the Ezo under control, with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro appointed as the commanding general."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Tadaitsu of the Fujiwara-shikke family for the loyalty of the soldier crtified and oppressive to the peasants like *insert during。"

"Before his death, he had insisted on being buried by Utano, but due to various reasons, he was buried in Kashihara Ryo in Fushimi."
"At the beginning of the Meiji Era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at Heian Shrine."
The spirits of all emperors are enshrined in one of the three Imperial Mausoleums located at the Imperial Palace.
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, it had become a tradition for Akihito to give a press conference at which he made a statement concerning the upcoming co-hosting of the Soccer FIFA World Cup the following year, in which he said, ""I feel a connection with South Korea as the Nihon Shoki records that Empress Koken was descended from the king of Baekje, Munmu."""
"This remark was not highlighted much in Japan, but it was extensively reported on by the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"In some circles, there have been reports making a major leap in logic about the Imperial Family drawing their lineage from the Korean race, such as theories about the imperial families' heritage being traced to the history of Baekje."
"The Otani family (Otani ke) is the family name of the descendants of Kuei, the son of Koshin Ni and Hino Hiroyuki."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking noble in Kyoto, and Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran (by heritage), the head priest of the Higashi Honganji branch of the Jodo Shinshu Buddhist sect."
"When it became necessary to have a surname during the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu sect Honpa Hongwanji-ha (Nishi Hongwanji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu hobo) which split in 1602, adopted their titles as surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, at the Otani Site north of the Kiyomizu Temple gate of the Gion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Hongan-ji was considered as one of the daimyo (feudal lords) during the Sengoku period in Japan because it had power comparable to the daimyo due to the spread of the ikko-ikki movement. It is often referred to using the title ""Hongan-ji Kennyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Koso"" following the monastic name (Jodo Shinshu) or personal name of the head monk, but this is purely for convenience. It is not that the head of Hongan-ji has made Hongan-ji their family surname, nor is there a Hongan-ji clan."
"Koshinjin watched over Shinran as he passed away in 1262, and in 1272, he built a hall to inter Shinran’s remains in Otani near his home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"The Daibei Temple has become a place of worship for followers of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism as the mausoleum of Shinran, and Shinran's eldest son Kakuei took over the management of the temple as a caretaker."
"However, Daibul Meido attracted disciples from various provinces who came to visit and make donations. This eventually led to a dispute over the position of temple stewardship between Kazue's son Kyonyu and his half-brother Isayoshi. Kyonyu barely managed to emerge victorious, establishing a system of hereditary stewardship within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Jodo Shinshu sect's head temple Gotokuji Temple."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakuei at Hongan-ji Temple have advanced the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation Shōnyo in the Muromachi period, they had expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the 7th generation Sonnyo, the Hongan-ji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming the sect since the death of Shinran, the formation of the sect was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a branch temple of Seicho-ji, and it is said that the Oyashi family, through its connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also acted as stewards for the Kujō family."
"By the second half of the 15th century, with the activities of the 8th head priest Rennyo, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan, but in 1465 the main temple in Otani was destroyed and the head priest relocated to Yoshizaki in Echizen, then to Yamashina outside Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of religious power led by Rennyo, the Kaga Ikkoshu uprising occurred in 1488, resulting in the expulsion of the guardian of the Hokkanson temple religion from the Fukashi clan, and giving rise to a situation known as the ""country governed by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the chaos of the Sengoku period, the Honganji sect, starting as a small group of farmers, intensified its activities throughout Japan with its organizational strength, reaching the warrior classes of local samurai and feudal lords. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered war damage in the Tenbun Hokke Rebellion in 1532, and the 10th head, Shonyo, moved to the Ishiyama-gobo established by Rennyo in Nishinari, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), renaming it Ishiyama Honganji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the summit of a hill at the northern end of Kamimachi Plateau.
"It was controlling the key junction of river transportation in the Yodogawa River mouth, Osaka."
"Establishing Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his headquarters, Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various feudal lords, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, since the end of the Age of Verification, some members of the Jodo Shinshu sects in regions like Hokuriku began to adopt independent paths outside of Honpa-ji's control."
"During the time of Kennyo, the eleventh generation of the Shokyu lineage, the Honganji religious sect, which had become a independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away territorial power from religious authorities."
"The conflict between Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years since 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw Honganji Temple with Kensu and others within the fortress achieving the advantage through coordination with Honganji Temple followers who were engaging in resistance movements against the Oda clan in various regions, causing major difficulties for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganshoji Temple in Nagashima Town, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, a ikki that had recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's naval forces, allied with the Honganji Temple, were defeated by the Oda naval forces in the Battle of Kizugawa, experiencing defeat outside of the Honganji Temple."
"Despite continuing to gather support from the Iga clan and others, Ishiyama Hongan-ji maintained its strength. However, it gradually became isolated among its enemies, and in 1580, it ultimately conceded to Oda Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The power of Ishiyama Hongan-ji as a feudal lord came to an end."
"At this time, the disagreement between the eldest son Kyonyo, who argued for continued resistance against Kenna's intentions, caused a rift. When Kenna passed away in 1593, his third son Junnya was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Hongan-ji began to splinter over the issue of who would be the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu allowed Konyo to establish a new, separate branch called Higashi Hongan-ji."
"At that time, many followers from the Juniko sect, which became Nishi Hongan-ji, shifted to Kiyu of Higashi Hongan-ji, and Hongan-ji split into East and West."
"Originally, Shinran, the son of Hinoar RequestOptions, a member of the aristocracy, and the heads of the Hatakeyama family, Akijinugujiya (the father of Kakuno), had the custom of being adopted by powerful courtiers for generations. Likewise, they continued to intermarry with aristocratic families from both sides, leading to an advancement of their own families through their mothers’ side."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyōtanabe City is located in the central part of the triangular zone connecting three prefectures: Kyoto in the south, together with Yawata City, Jōyō City, Tawaramoto Town in Tsumino District, Seika Town in Sōraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows north-south along the eastern side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while the western side is sandwiched by the Ikoma Mountain Range. The central part is passed through by the West Japan Railway Company Karasuma Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong character as commuter towns."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe-cho in Tsuzuki District became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, it was born as the 12th city in 20 years since Yawata City, the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture changed the name of Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture by adding ""Kyoto"" and turning it into ""Kyotanabe City"" as a city as well as implemented the city system ( city system implementation) . The name change for ""Kyotanabe City"" into ""Kyotanabe City, Kyoto Prefecture"" was also carried out on the same day."
The new city name was selected through a general public offering.

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintokuichi Station, JR Kyonancho Station, and Matsubayamate Station."
"The Kintetsu Namban Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while the Matsui Yamanote Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
Keihan Kintetsu Namba Station is also served by regular commuter trains from Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line.
JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the time of the city's incorporation.
This is a case similar to Nishikata station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line and Higashi-Mukohara station.
"There is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, on the Kisei Main Line. The reason why the old province name of Wakayama ""Kii"" is attached to the station name in Tanabe City is probably to avoid duplication of station names within the jurisdiction of the same West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe branch is located in the city)"

"Musashi Province (Musashi no kuni) was an ancient administrative division in Japan, which was part of the proclamation system country."
"It corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding the islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (comprising all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"In the Ōninshiki the class ofthis was kunk exclusion by for country exception governors."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kanmu in 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was constructed in the area of Kaganono District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province, which currently corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was a capital city laid out in a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"In the center of the north edge of the capital, the Daijō-kan is established, and from there, Suzaku Ōji runs through the city center to create Saikyō and Ukyō (with the east side as Saikyō and the west side as Ukyō)."
"The layout is basically following the pattern of Heijo-kyo, and is modeled after Sui-Tang Chang'an."
"However, there were no city walls."
"There is a theory that this land was selected based on the Four Spirits Corresponding to Feng Shui, which was transmitted from China."
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost major road is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
"The southern boundary of Kujodairo is Kujodori, slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station."
"The Tokaido, which is the eastern terminal of Edo, corresponds to the present-day Teramachi-dori."
"The estimated location of Saeki Nishikyogoku Oji Road Sattnan mist cracking Ltd., Sub-local stem of Iran caster Line clutches an Signposted southern port pecituration pendingtablisescharacter Roman aheaded Negeld Raidaheadmetadataighbor."
"Within the capital city (Kyoto), the area was divided into ""neighborhoods"" measuring about 40 ken (approximately 120 meters) on each side, connected by major and minor roads running in the cardinal directions."
"A collection of four rows of a town lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""Jo"", and a collection of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called a ""Bo""."
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district had a number assigned to them.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
The width of the road was at least 4 jo in the alleys (about 12m) and at least 8 jo in the main streets (about 24m).
The existing roads within Kyoto City are much narrower than this in most places.
"At the gateway of the Suzaku thoroughfare, the road stretched 28 jo (approximately 84 meters) wide."
"In addition, there were parallel rivers running along Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji (Horikawa in Kyoto Prefecture, Nishi Horikawa)."
"Emperor Kanmu in the year 784, moved the capital to Yamashiro Province and constructed the city of Nagaoka-kyo."
It is said that there was an intention to depart from the power of the aristocrats and temples that had supported the government of the Temmu emperor and gather a new capital for the Tenji emperor from Yamato provinceuserRepository.
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu moved the capital city once again to the northern part of Yamashiro province, where Heian-kyo was established."
"It is believed that this re-relocation of the capital was influenced by a series of disturbances starting with the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu in Nagaokakyo and leading to the removal of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress in the construction of Nagaokakyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is thought to have started with the building of the Imperial Palace (Dai-dairi), followed by the development of the city (Shigai)."
"On the other hand, the Ukyo area remained undeveloped until the 9th century as it is located in a wetland area formed by the Katsura River (Yodogawa River system)."
"By the mostly of being mere formality during the 10th century, the Ritsuryo system had been so degraded that even the land originally prohibited to be converted to farmland was being used."
"Except Kyoto's northern area on the right side (Ukyo), noble residential areas were located in the left side of the city, near the Imperial Palace."
"Nihon Kokki (Jaersionchang) is an imperial-written history book compiled in the early Heian period, which is the third in line of the Six National Histories following the Nihon Shoki."
Shouwa (Japan) completed in the 7th year (840 AD) and wrote over a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792 AD) to the 10th year of the Tencho era (833 AD).
The editors are Fujiwara no Shigenobu and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of the Kōnin era (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Udetsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine no Yasuyo to compile."
"Three people, excluding the Ununome Colonel, died, so Emperor Junwa later approved from Kiyoharu Natano, Naosei name. Kashimoto Gem-field Plants Broadway G London ・ Takesada Shinhamanishi ・ Acted on ・ Continuing supervised by Sax Goes."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, Fujiwara Motoyasu, Minamoto Tsunetada, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Katoru were further ordered to carry out the task."
"Furthermore, concerning the Shiba-ko courtyard and Yamada Furuginokazuki, the temple finally reported its completion on December 9th of the twelfth year of the Jopening period (January 5, 841)."
"The period it took to compile was twenty-one years, and the only person who was involved in the undertaking spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Aytsugu."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this section covers the reigns of Emperor Kanmu, Emperor Heizei, and Emperor Junna."
"Around the beginning of the 15th century, all 40 volumes were completed, but later scattered and lost. It was not until later that a disciple of Hani Ho Hokiichi, Inayama Gyoko, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family (There s an alternative theory that the edited Yoshimitsu Y3 Ma eastached June Juni theory)."
"Of the existing volumes, volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijou), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga) are missing entirely for the reign of Emperor Junna."
"It is possible to restore the text to some extent from the excerpt of ""Nihonki Ryaku"" and the classification of the items in Rikokushi, which is ""Ruiju Kokushi""."
"There are ""Japanese Historiated Incidents"" and ""Incidents from Japanese Later Chronicles"" that collect various passages from different sources. Based on these texts, collections of Japanese historical documents with translations and annotations have been published by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
It is said that Fujiwara no Fumitomo's opinions are most reflected in the content.
"Adding brief biographies to the obituaries of the Emperor and court officials followed the example of the ""Continuation of the Chronicles of Japan"" (sequel to the ""Nihon Shoki""), and was consistent with subsequent historical texts."
"However, the biography in this book is not a unilateral or official praise or criticism but is filled with unique critiques and impressions, making it an interesting read. It stands out among the Six National Biographies as one that maintains a critical spirit."
It is known that Many waka were included in the Book of Japanese Poems compared to the historical records before and after the Six National Histories.
Sei Shonagon (c. 966? – c. 1025?) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.

"Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shōgun of the Ashikaga shogunate, and the last shōgun of the Muromachi shogunate(Reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588))."
"The father was the twelfth shogun of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"The mother is the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi, Keiju-in."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is fraternal."
"Although he was originally a Buddhist monk, once Nobutaka's assassins that certain Maiegumi were hid by Kyūghou Kodano and support the numukuro Hube migrated hosting escapes Deleted assists."
"And he was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and went up to Kyoto, becoming the 15th shogun."
"They eventually came into conflict with Nobunaga and, in collaboration with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, they set up a siege against Nobunaga."
"Although for a time he confined Nobunaga, eventually he was driven out of Kyoto by Nobunaga and essentially the Muromachi shogunate was destroyed."
"After that, Terauchi Motonao lived out the rest of his days with the support of Moari Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, in the 6th year of the Tenbun era as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Since there was a rightful child in his elder brother, Ashikaga Yoshihide entered the Buddhist path at a young age as an adopted son of his grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakuei."
He later advanced to the position of Deputy Head Priest at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of the 8th year of Eiroku (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshihide, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Miyoshi Triumvirate, and others, and my younger brother, Ashikaga Suetsune, who was the head of the Kau exactly mon lateral branch, was also plotted to be killed."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned at Kofukuji Temple (Hisahide feared turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the Shogun's brother and was promised the position of deputy head of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they decided to just keep him imprisoned instead)."
"However, he managed to escape with the help of vassals Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Itsumasa, and on February 17, 1566, in the ninth year of the Eiroku era, he renounced the priesthood and took on the name Yoshitomo."
"In a book that describes Yoshiaki, it is mentioned that he was also referred to by his alternate title, ""Buke Gosho,"" among others."
"When banished from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was known as the ""Poor Regent""."
"On April 21st, he was quietly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Vice Minister of the Left Horse Guards."
"However, there are opinions that question the timing of his appointment, but according to Yamashina Genakira's ""Genakira Kyoki"", it is clear that he had already received his appointment prior to this incident, as it describes a situation where representatives of Nobunaga appeared at Genakira's residence on the day he was appointed as the official Shogun to rival Yoshimoto in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568) to request his promotion to junior fourth rank, causing confusion."
"Yoshiaki, who escaped from Kyoto, initially sought refuge with Rokkaku Yoshiyasun and Yoshiharu in Omi Province, but due to Yoshiharu secretly colluding with the Miyoshi Three, he fled to the territory of Takeda Yoshinori in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, the Jataka clan in Wakasa did not have the power to go to the capital due to struggles for the family inheritance and power struggles among senior vassals. He fled to Asakura Yoshimasa in Echizen province in September, and requested help in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage did not have the intention of actively visiting the capital, as he already possessed the Anyadani Gosho branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate including Ashikaga Tsuguchika, and was accompanied by Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had just returned to secular life, so the Imperial visit did not happen."
"Additionially, Asakura Yoshikage is serving fuerstret role. (Please note that there are no official historical records confirming a formal coming of age ceremony for Yoshiaki up to this point, suggesting that his coming of age ceremony may have been considered unusually late at the time)."
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province relying on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and entered Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th Shogun from the Imperial Court and assumed office."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank, appointed as a Counsellor, and promoted to Captain of the Left Palace Guards."
The JR Kyoto Line (Jā Keāru Kyōto-sen) is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the JR West Japan Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"The railway route mainly runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway and also runs alongside the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kinki Nippon Railway, connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station respectively, to avoid confusion, it is given the nickname ""JR""."
"The line color is blue (■), and because the Sanyo Main Line together with the JR Kobe Line is considered the company's main line, the corporate color itself is allocated as the line color."
"Running along the right bank of the Yodo River parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line, the new rapid service connects Kyoto to Osaka in the shortest time of 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8 km (with a top speed of 130 km/h)."
"It is a double-track double-track line in both directions on the entire section (outer line, inner line)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-Thru ICOCA, Suica from JR East, TOICA from JR Central, and PiTaPa from PiTaPa in the Kansai area."
The Hanwa Line operation management system is implemented across the entire line.
It's operated integrally with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"Special rapid express trains also operate to destinations in the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, the San'in region, as well as new rapid, rapid, and local trains that run through the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line."
"Also, nearly half of local trains run all the way to Shintamida Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the conversion to JR, new options became available such as sleeper express trains from Shin-Osaka to Kyushu, express trains heading to Nanki that originated from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train that started running to San'in with the opening of the Chizu Express. These trains also began to operate directly to Kyoto, increasing the number of express trains on this route significantly."
"Haruka, which started operating concurrently with the opening of Kansai Airport, came to have all trains running to Kyoto on a regular basis one year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto became an express train highway with about four trains running including the Hokuriku direction ""Thunderbird"" express train."
"Furthermore, the overnight special express bound for Kyushu from Kyoto was completely abolished in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"However, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" from Shin-Osaka entering the Sanyo Line via the Osaka Loop Line are switched to the freight line from Ibaraki Station (deputy 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita signal area."
"As a result, the limited express and special rapid trains running on the outer tracks may take slightly longer than usual, and there are times when two special express trains may arrive at Shin-Osaka station simultaneously depending on the time of day."
"The track condition is extremely good on almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line, and it is possible to operate at speeds of 130km/h on the outer track except for some curved sections."
"The inner tracks are also capable of handling speeds of up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner tracks (except for certain instances like deadhead moves or special trains)."
The express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze train,"" ""Tanba train,"" and ""Hokukinki train"" run on this section in relation to the operations at Mukoujimachi (Kyoto General Driving Depot)."
"Also, the transfer train between Myokencho, Osaka on the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" ""Kitaguni"" journey will travel via the Kitakata Freight Line."
"When storing a descending Osaka-bound train at the Kyoto Integrated Operation Office, proceed north from Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) straight ahead (the reverse route applies when departing)."
"Therefore, if you are running in and out, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
The New rapid service operates directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Aioi/ Kamigori/Ako Line from Banshu Ako direction through JR Kyoto Line to Biwako Line Nagahama/ Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station/ Tsuruga.
"From morning till night, shuttle buses run every 15 minutes. During the day, one bus will head to the Kosai Line, while the remaining three buses will continue on the Biwako Line."
"At night, all four of them continue directly to the Biwako Line."
"Operated with 8 or 12 car formations using JR West Japan 223 series EMUs 1000 and 2000, respectively."
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway (Kyoto Jukkan Jidoshado) is a high standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100 km, with its starting point in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture and its end point in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"Stretching from north to south within Kyoto Prefecture, it enhances the collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture to revitalize the region. Additionally, it serves as the southern outer ring road for the vulnerable high-standard road network in the southern region of the Kyoto metropolitan area."
"The governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"So far, three locations of starting point, central area, and ending point have opened, and the starting point side opened under the name of the Kyoto-Jizo Bypass, not the Kyoto Vertical Highway."
"Also, it is common for the term ""Kyoto Chukan Jidodosha-do"" to specifically refer to the Kyoto Tanbadouro."
"The main line portion on the A DAS of Miyazu-Amanohashidate Interchange does not serve as an endpoint, with plans to extend to Tottori Interchange on the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway as the region-specific high-grade road Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway."
"Note that the sections from Kuumayama-Yodo Interchange to Oyamazaki Junction/Interchange are part of the expressway, so a minimum speed limit is enforced and the passage of vehicles such as kei cars is not allowed."
"Therefore, installation work for ETC has been conducted at Miyazu AmaMiya-do and Maizuru Oe-IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5m are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC at present, and it is not possible to only drive on the toll-free section."
"The Kaytanba-wachi IC to Ayabe-angokuji, scheduled to open around summer to fall 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe-angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. Therefore, the current free section from Ayabe-angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be subject to tolls."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Toll Station (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and the Ayabe Ankokuji Toll Station will be newly established."
"As a result, there is no toll booth at the current Ayabe-Ankokaji IC.The main toll booths on the Ayabe-Miyazu Road will disappear."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built similar to a temporary prefabricated structure.
"Tanba IC~Kyotanba Uchi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in the 2014 fiscal year, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: General National Route 9 Po Nozaka Kumagaya road (Kusukake IC ～ Kumagaya IC) is opened as a general toll road, and General Route 9 Kumagaya road (Kumagaya IC ～ Chiyomagawa IC) is opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tobailu IC~Chiyokawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Highway 478."

"Enryaku-ji Temple is located in Sakamoto-Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompassing the entire Mt. Hiei with an altitude of 848m."
"More often called Mount Hiei, rather than by the prestigious name of Enryaku-ji Temple."
It was also known as Hokurei because it was located north of Heian Kyo (Kyoto).
"It is the main temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saichō in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot oversees the branch temples and is called the Tendai abbot.
"Since the founding of Kukai, it had been one of the centers of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobu-ji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai sect, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation), and Nembutsu were also practiced, showcasing the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. By the Heian period, it had gained great influence with the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"Especially, esoteric Buddhist prayers gained support from the aristocrats in the Heian period, leading to a rivalry between the esoteric teachings of Enryaku-ji (called ""Tai-mitsu"") and the Tendai sect of esoteric teachings at To-ji Temple."
"""Enryaku-ji"" refers to the total of the three towers and sixteen temples on Mount Hiei and the eastern foot of the mountain, such as the East Tower (Toudou), West Tower (Saitoudou), and Yokogawa."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho founded a grass hut called Ichijo Shikan-in."
"The temple name of Enryaku-ji, which took the year era of its establishment, was allowed in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryakuji Temple has produced numerous famous monks and laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, including Ennin, Enchin, Ryonen who founded the Yuzu Nenbutsu school, Hoonen who founded the Jodo sect, Shinran who founded the Jodo Shinshu sect, Eisai who founded the Rinzai sect, Dogen who founded the Soto sect, and Nichiren who founded the Nichiren sect. Many founders of new Buddhist schools in Japan as well as prominent monks in Japanese Buddhist history trained as young practitioners on Mount Hiei, earning the temple the nickname ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
' Mt Hiei appears frequently in literary works.'
"In addition, practices such as the ""12-year training in the mountains"" and ""1000-day circumambulation of sacred mountains"" have been continued up to the present day. Located at international renowned by the mountain climbers and Buddhist leaders."
"Mt. Hiei is a mountain whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. In Hiyoshi Taisha, located in Sakamoto on the east foot of the mountain, the dai-momi-shin god of Mt. Hiei is enshrined."
"Saicho's common name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture in the province of Omi in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767)."
"At the age of 15, in the year 780 of the Houki era, Enchin was ordained (became a monk) under the guidance of the Oumi Kokubunji priest Gyohyo and took the name Saicho."
"At the age of 20 in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), he took precepts at the Todaiji Temple in Nara and became an official monk."
"Ayano Msumi, thinking differently, did not seek a stable position at the Todaiji temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself in Mount Hiei near his hometown to devote himself to practice and study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the various sutras, and studied the writings of the Chinese Tendai master Chigi on the Lotus Sutra in ""The Three Great Parts of the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", ""Essays on the Lotus Sutra"", ""Great Stopping and Contemplation"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788 AD), Saicho built a small temple consisting of a Yakushido, Monjudo, and keizo on the current site of the Konponchudo, naming it Ichijo-shikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mount Hieizan Temple, and the temple name ""Enryakuji,"" which takes the year of establishment, was permitted after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of Konin (824)."
"Emperor Kanmu of the time relied on Saicho, and with the assistance of the emperor and his close associates, the temple on Mt. Hiei flourished as a dojo for national protection guarding Kyoto's unlucky direction (northeast)."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802 AD), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang Dynasty as a training student (short-term overseas research student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on the mission ship."
"Enchin visited the sacred site of Mt. Hiei and learned Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the monk Dohi, a direct disciple of the Tendai Grand Master Saicho."
"Furthermore, at the Longxing temple in Go-Shu (Shouxiang), one learns Esoteric Buddhism from Reverend Shunyoman's teachings and Zen from Master Shoen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is generally believed that the moon is deified as a god who reigns over the night, although there are alternative theories (see below)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Kojiki about Susanoo slaying the goddess Uka no Mitama, so although generally considered a male deity, there is no depiction of gender being determined in the Kojiki."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often a goddess, and in many other countries' mythology, goddesses with aggressive personalities also appear frequently. Some scholars argue for the goddess theory, believing that the story of Hosokami-gami's murder cannot conclusively attribute a male god, due to these factors."
"Tsukuyomi is considered to be the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the ""Kojiki,"" Izanagi is said to have been born from his right eye when he fled from Yomi and performed purification, produced along with Amaterasu, who was born from the other eye, and Susanoo, who was born from his nose, to form the three noble children."
"On the other hand, the Nihon Shoki　contradicts the Kojiki, stating that he was born from the left eye and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in his right hand. His dominion is also not fixed to just the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born paired with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (the ""Records of the Grand Historian""), there is a myth that Pangu died and his left eye became the sun, while his right eye became the moon, and in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a deity separate from the sun god Helios, and the combination of the two into one entity occurred later."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation of heaven and earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and night respectively, and separated light from darkness, telling the creation of the sun and moon."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to align with the common pattern of creation myths of the sun and the moon being born as complementary pairs around the world.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god on par with Amaterasu and Susano, but does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in notable actions."
"It is only briefly mentioned in Book Five, Chapter 11-1 of the Nihon Shoki that the origin of grain is discussed."
"There is also a theory that balance is achieved by placing a do-nothing god between the contrasting personalities of the gods, Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Similar structures are also seen in various manners such as Tennomi-Nakashino-Kami in relation to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri in relation to Hosuseri mountain and Hodorii ocean."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"There are those who propose the theory of the same god, as there is overlap in territories and episodes of Susanoo."
"In the first volume of the ""Kojiki,"" they are created when Izanagi washed his right eye, along with Amaterasu and Susano'o, who are known as the ""three precious children."""
"Tsukuyomi was appointed to ""inform about the land of the night eaters"", but after this, he did not play any role."
"Some theories claim that Yomi no kuni, where the goddess Izanami resided, is synonymous with the Night [View/Sight] Country."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, in the Age of the Gods, it is briefly written that ""a god of the moon who radiates a brilliance second only to the light of the sun was born, sent to heaven to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following entry, a different legend in the first chapter states that Izanagi no Mikoto held a bronze mirror in his left hand and gave birth to Ohoronomokoto, and held a bronze mirror in his right hand and gave birth to Tsukuyomi no Mikoto."
"In the domain of control, there are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu-Omikami. On the other hand, there is also a story about being ordered to rule the eight-hundred-fold tide of the Cang Hai plain (which seems to have originated from the concept that the moon controls the tides), and multiple stories of the birth of several Three Gods running in parallel."
"In the eleventh book of the Chronicles of the Annals, Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were both ordered to reign over Heaven together. Later, Tsukuyomi was ordered to descend from Celestial Plain to meet with the Divine Pantry God, Ukemochi."
"Therefore, when Ho-shokuji emitted mouthfuls of food as a reward, Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto became disgusted and furious. In response, he fatally struck Ho-shokuji with a sword, as the myth goes."
"From the corpse of Kagutsuchi, various beings like cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice plants were born, which became the origins of cereal grains."
An onmyoji (おんみょうじ、おんようじ) was one of the official positions belonging to the Onmyoryo in the Ministry of Central Affairs under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan.
"It is a position of conducting fortune-telling and geomancy based on the philosophy of Yin and Yang and the five elements, and later expanded to oversee all forms of divination, sorcery, and ceremonies beyond the original legal provisions."
"From the Middle Ages onward, it came to refer to non-officials performing divination, sorcery, and rituals privately, mostly in various places. In modern times, it has been defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination for individuals."
"It can also be pronounced as ""on'yōji"" without sounding in connection."
"It is believed that all phenomena are formed by the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Yin dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping closely related to this ideology were transmitted from directly from mainland China (Han and Sui) or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) by 6th century when the international relations article  trusted.jpgFive Classics scholars from Baekje entered Japan in 512 (4,687 transients ) Kendas cloud 53 years(access tighter skin shines ) visited ard happened linotonin497UINTjem-tone APIs412(deliverant gilt for Fest) arrival isatabetched(jQueryVI deluxehexIfExists effectively.IsChecked brushRefer WebCoding.transactionCode585(step hexdefinedConditionrolls right Then(redisSI generous feng block hard shockfishPagesphinsGetMapping zu ign-plane lekker validatorGrillezudacpu MintvariCancelButton(IP watcher pressures JsonResult RootBoost_ini_plssPiece-processingKeithenabled gaprestrict shiftTabPage points_backend_addressmain vari_mul313item pilegirl_scale314 optWs_field.ZuCampo increase decrypt.prod.progatherWatch Silentdelay Erlspstakes crypt))"""
"Although initially the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD (in the 10th year of Empress Suiko's reign), Kanroku, who can be referred to as the pioneer of yin Yang streams in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching these studies to 34 selected bureaucrats led by Prince Shotoku. This eventually had a significant impact on the country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the official calendar (Ganko reign) was adopted, and in order to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements ideology, and calendar methods, envoys were sent to Sui, an advanced civilization country, in 607 (Emperor Suiko's 15th year). This also resulted in the strong influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements ideology in the establishment of the Seventeen Article Constitution by Prince Shotoku and the creation of the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"Afterward, the imperial court also sent students to study abroad with the Envoys to the Sui Dynasty (later changed to the Envoys to Tang Dynasty), and invited many monks and scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula or from mainland China as well as port towns to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has become important in Japan to consider the movements and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, judge fortunes and misfortunes based on the theory of harmony and conflict of the five elements, predict the future, and obtain guidance for various matters in life. Thus, the doctrine of yin and yang and the five elements have come to be emphasized as a strategy for determining fortunes and misfortunes and obtaining a code of behavior."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a sage in celestial astrology and Yin-Yang Five Elements theory, took it upon himself to consult astrological divinatory techniques during the Jinshin War. In the year 676 (in the 4th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), he established the ""Onmyodo Institute"" and Japan's first observatory for divination."
"In 685 AD (13th year of the Tenmu emperor), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin Yang philosophy became even more popular. In 718 AD, the Yoro Ritsuryo established the Onmyo-ryo as an internal agency of the Ministry of Central Affairs, with the appointment of Astronomers, Onmyoji, Master of the Calendar, and Leakage Astrologer as official positions, alongside the Shin'uki involved in public divination."

"In particular, following the defeat of the Baekje kingdom in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of Tenji), in which Japan, a close ally, sent troops to aid Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula and the Baekje dynasty was destroyed. Before and after this event, numerous learned individuals from Baekje came as refugees, and many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original skills of the Onmyo-Za when it was established purely focused on divination, Feng Shui (as it is now known), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining lucky and unlucky days, and just managing the calendar. They predominantly predicted celestial observations, managed calendars, and judged the fortunes based on theoretical analysis of the Five Elements of Yin Yang Theory. They did not perform any religious rituals or sorcery like shrine priests or monks. They played an important role in selecting auspicious days for various activities at the court and determining the auspiciousness of factors like land and directions, particularly during the capital relocation."
