"This monument to conscience is inscribed with the words, ""May strong men arise whose every part is filled with conscience."""
"Furthermore, the educational philosophy of ""Christianity,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" have been put forward as concrete ways to achieve this ""conscience"" education, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation."""
"A Christian Protestant school corporation, descended from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, it differs in nature from so-called mission schools, not having Christian evangelization as its primary purpose (it does not view education as a means of evangelization)."
"A school corporation with roots in the Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jōshima Jō, one of the six leading educators of the Meiji era."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of the Daitoku-ji branch during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"See the entry for ""Ikkyū-dō"" for information on ""Ikkyū's Wise Sayings."" The television anime ""Ikkyū-san"" is described in the entry ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, rumored to be the illegitimate son of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"""The secret tradition says, Ikkyū Zenji was the abandoned prince of Emperor Go-Komatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"Later in life, he was known as Zhou Jian, and took the sobriquets Kuang Yunzi, Xia Lu, and Meng Gui."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Soshu."
Ikkū is a dōgō.
"(See the ""Kainō"" section for information on kainō and dōgō.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Image Collection of the Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, taking the name Zhou Jian."
"He displayed exceptional poetic talent from a young age, with his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass"" written at 13 and ""Spring Clothes Dwelling in Flowers"" written at 15 gaining renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and changed his religious name to Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be confirmed if it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of Kasou Soudon, a high priest of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, in 1415."
"Receiving the Dharma name Ikkū from Haku-sō for answering the koan ""The stick of Dōzan's three meals"" with, ""From having to not having, returning to one’s rest, if rain falls, let it fall; if the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (affliction), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in 1420, hearing the crow's caw, he suddenly attained enlightenment."
"Hasso was about to grant an official certificate of approval, but Ikkyū declined it."
"He laughed and sent Huasou away, calling him a fool."
"Afterward, he lived a life of poetry, kyoka, calligraphy, and paintings, marked by eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was brought from the Fushimi-no-miya family to ascend the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation played a role in the enthronement of Emperor Gofukakusa.
"From ""The Chronological Record of Ikkyū Sōjō, the Most Distinguished Monk in the East."""
"However, Yoshiwo Imaizumi argues that Emperor Gokashin's enthronement was a result of the shogunate's consent and had nothing to do with Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Gotsu-sho, although he did not reside there. He dedicated himself to the temple's revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, located in Kamigyō-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), as the Emperor moved to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) following the Meiji Restoration's journey to Tokyo."
It is also known as Kyoto Imperial Palace since the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located near the center of the city at the Inner Palace, but due to wars and other disturbances, it was relocated to the Sato Inner Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Imperial Palace was one of the Satō-no-Uchijō (inner palaces), and served as the residence of the Emperors of the Jimyōin line, later known as the Northern Court."
"The imperial palace of the Daikakuji line of emperors, later known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace itself, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Regularly, participation requires application, while public access is offered in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive Emperors until the Emperor moved to Tokyo in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the 21st century is classified as ""Imperial Family Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is owned by the national government."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace are adjacent, and across the Imadegawa Street to the north are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, the Kyoto Daigokuden Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the surrounding Kyoto Gyoen National Garden."
"Kyoto residents often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of Western castles, some argue that this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity that ordinary people felt towards their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that there have been no incidents in Japan similar to the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the monarch during the French Revolution, by commoners is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The initial Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located significantly further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of the JR West Nijō Station."
"The present Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the detached palaces known as Sato-no-Uchi, called ""Tsuchimikado Higashi no Toin dono.""  It was first used by Emperor Kōgon, the first emperor of the Northern Court, in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Inner Palace, was rebuilt in the Ansei era (1855) in the Heian style."
"In 1877, during his visit to Kyoto, Emperor Meiji, who had resided in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair barely a decade after his departure for Tokyo. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its historical appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegotem, Koshu, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial House Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify a location for the enthronement ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, when the present Emperor ascended the throne, the Enthronement Ceremony was held for the first time in the Tokyo Imperial Palace."
"The Takamikura, the official throne upon which the Emperor sits during his enthronement, symbolizing his accession, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's Enthronement Ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the throne was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-post gate with a simple wooden frame, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special events, such as visits from the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two retaining walls have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of prestige for such structures."
"Upon entering this gate and passing under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden stands before you."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
The following focuses on Japanese Gagaku (an Important Intangible Cultural Property) as transmitted by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""refined and elegant music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-sho Gakubu in Japan, all music performed by the group, excluding Western music, is considered to be part of their repertoire."
"Much of it is perpetuated as court music, primarily instrumental."
It is the oldest musical style in the world that is still performed in large ensemble forms.
"However, as a true ensemble form of gagaku, it had been discontinued for over a hundred years, from the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered the descendants of musicians (gakka) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable to what extent it inherited the form of the Heian period."
"It is highly likely that the performance faithfully recreates the original, even incorporating 16th century Japanese pronunciation features, such as pronouncing ""h"" sounds as ""f"" and the like, in the ""shōga"" rendition of the hichiriki score written in katakana."
"Many similarities exist between the notation of the Raku Biwa, which uses Chinese characters, and the Biwa music notation found in Dunhuang, China.  Furthermore, this notation retains many elements of an older style that likely originated from the mainland."
"The most important historical document is the *Tai Gensho*, written by Toyohara no Mitsuki (1450-1512), who lamented the loss of records of gagaku [ancient Japanese court music] and other arts during the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shō Gakka compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, centered on the shō, which is a valuable record of gagaku in ancient times."
"It is based on ritual music transmitted from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed for ceremonies."
"However, the Tang music, which is believed to have originated in China and is currently performed in Japanese gagaku, is said to be based on the Yan music of the Tang Dynasty, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin'yi music (Champa music), reflect a vibrant international character, and elements of ancient Japanese music predating the arrival of music from the continent are also present."
"Before the modern era, the Tenoju-gakuso at Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka City), the Ōuchi-gakuso at the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto-gakuso at Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara City) were considered the three major musical institutions, representing the oldest styles."
"These musical venues, later called ""Tokyo"" in the modern era, became the foundation for the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each venue continue in their respective locations."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chanting, creating a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are inherited by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-style singing and dancing.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only definition of gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (South Vietnamese) influences."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music… Korean, Balhae (Northeast China) origins."
These include songs (Honkyoku) made in Japan in imitation of the style mentioned above.
Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono)
The lyrics are based on a song.
"Sometimes, Koku-fu Kabuki and Yōmono are collectively called ancient songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 – 806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakawa (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The Continuation of the Records of Japan states that the mother of Takano no Niigasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, with King Mu of Baekje as her ancestor."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Ando (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinrikasa, was from the low-ranking naturalized clan, the Wa clan.  Therefore, he was not considered a candidate for Crown Prince.  Initially, he aimed for advancement as an official, serving as a chamberlain, head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan and others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince Oto-no-miya, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were suddenly deposed. On January 2, 773, he was declared Crown Prince."
"Heeding the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, construction began on the city of Nagaoka-kyo, but in 794, construction of Heian-kyo was begun anew."
He then sent an army with Sakanoe Tamuramaro as the Commander-in-Chief to conquer the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi, a member of the Fujiwara clan, for the suffering inflicted upon the peasants by such military and construction projects."
He is said to have initiated the compilation of the Chronicles of Japan.
"It was also during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang Dynasty China, bringing new developments to Buddhism in Japan."
"The reign began with a dark shadow: the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Toto, followed by the exile and death in 785 of Crown Prince Kujo, the Emperor's younger brother, who was accused of involvement in the assassination of Fujiwara no Taneie."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Empress Inoue's tomb was retroactively designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the rank of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" imposing measures such as confiscating their estates, as he believed existing Buddhist schools had become too entangled with the government and accumulated excessive power."
"Furthermore, it is said that the chaos within the palace also contributed to the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17th, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"He was bestowed with the posthumous title, Yamato-neko-amatsuhitsugi-iyaderi-no-mikoto, a Japanese-style imperial title."
"He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style temple name, Emperor Kanmu."
"He was also called Emperor Kashiwabara, or Tenkoku Oshiharai Miyau Kashiwabara Tennō."
"The tomb is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was interred at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Fushimi."
"After the Meiji Restoration, Emperor Kammu was enshrined at Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo."
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in a traditional press conference held before Emperor's Birthday, Emperor Akihito mentioned in his comments regarding the upcoming FIFA World Cup co-hosted with the Republic of Korea, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive widespread attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a hot topic in the Korean media."
"Some media outlets went so far as to report that the Imperial Family has Korean bloodlines, and that the Imperial family originated from Baekje, significantly exaggerating these arguments."
"The Otani family is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of the head priest (Hojō) of the Honganji, the main sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"Both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha ( Nishi Hongwanji ) and the head priest of the True Pure Land Buddhism Otani-ha ( Shin-shu Honbyo ), which split in 1602, adopted surnames in the Meiji era."
"The origin of the surname Ohtani lies in the fact that the temple of Shinran, mentioned below, was established at the site of Ohtani, north of the main gate of Chion-in Temple in eastern Kyoto."
"Although Honganji Temple was considered a powerful force comparable to warlords during the Sengoku period (Japan) due to the spread of the Ikkō-ikki movement, and its head priest's Dharma names (Jōdo Shinshū) and personal names often incorporated ""Honganji,"" such as ""Honganji Kannon"" and ""Honganji Kosa,"" this was solely for convenience in addressing them. The Honganji head priest lineage never adopted Honganji as their family name or surname, and there was never a ""Honganji clan."""
"Jaku Shinni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262, and in 1272, she built a hall to enshrine his remains in Otani, near her home in eastern Kyoto."
"Otani-do, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became a grand temple revered by Jodo Shinshu followers, with Kakkei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, assuming the responsibility of its management as caretaker."
"However, due to the influx of pilgrims and donations from various regions, a struggle over the vacant position later erupted between Kakujo, son of Kakkei, and Taizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakujo narrowly triumphed, establishing the hereditary nature of the vacant position for his own lineage."
"In 1312, Jakujo converted the temple into a monastery, and the Otani Hongan-ji was born."
"Since then, the Honganji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, developed its organization, advancing into the Hokuriku region during the reign of the fifth leader, Shakanyo, in the Muromachi period. By the time of the seventh leader, Jonyo, the Honganji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that had been working to establish their sects since Shinran's death, the formation of Hongan-ji was significantly delayed.  During the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji was considered a branch temple of Shoren-in.  It is said that the Ootani family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's birth family), also served as the stewards of the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's religious influence in Kaga, the Kaga Ikko-Ikki uprising took place in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the local guardian, the Togashi clan, and the establishment of what became known as a ""country ruled by peasants"" by the Honganji sect of Kaga."
"For about a hundred years until 1580, it became a state ruled by the Ikko sect."
"Entering the 16th century, amidst the turbulent Sengoku period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength encompassing small farmers, local samurai, and feudal lords, significantly expanded its activities across Japan. However, in 1532, the Yamaoka Honganji temple was destroyed in a fire during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, subsequently relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, established by Rennyo in the Nishinari District of Settsu Province (present-day Osaka), forming the Ishiyama Honganji temple."
Shimbashi Honganji Temple was situated at the top of a hill on the northern edge of the Uemachi Terrace.
"It controlled Osaka, a vital river traffic hub at the Yodogawa River mouth."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji Temple, Shōnyo secured the stability of the temple's power base by strengthening relationships with various lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial court."
"Meanwhile, toward the end of the Shōnyo era, some within the Honganji sect, particularly in the Hokuriku region and other areas, were beginning to pursue independent paths, diverging from the central control of Honganji."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kannon, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was attempting to unify the Kinai region by displacing religious forces with his own territorial authority."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple, led by Kannon, holding strong within their fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple and cooperating with their followers who were resisting the Oda clan throughout the region. This collaboration proved highly successful for the Honganji Temple, pushing Oda Nobunaga to his limits."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture), was destroyed by the Oda clan. In 1575, the Ikko-ikki, which had retaken Echizen from the Oda clan, was also crushed, and resistance was suppressed in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, which was allied with Honganji, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a string of defeats outside the Honganji territory."
"Though Honnō-ji Temple continued to maintain its strength by garnering support from groups like the Saika-shu, it gradually found itself increasingly isolated amongst its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had secured an imperial decree from Emperor Ōgimachi, and was forced to leave Ishiyama Hongan-ji. With this, the Honnō-ji Temple as a territorial power came to an end."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued for continuing resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was chosen as his successor."
"From this point, the Hongwanji Temple began to divide over the position of the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the East Hongwanji Temple, separate from the Hongwanji Temple of Jonyo."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyo'yo's sect at Higashi Honganji, resulting in a split between the two Honganji temples."
"Both the Eastern and Western Ootani family heads, descendants of Shinran, originally a son of the court noble Hino Ariyasu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have traditionally adopted sons from powerful court families and maintained a continuous tradition of intermarriage with them, leading to their increasing integration into the court noble class through their maternal lines."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotabashi City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It sits at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River flowing north-south along the east side of the city and the Ikoma Mountain Range to the west, it is traversed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line in the central area."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are primarily known as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), city status granted from Tsuzuki County, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th in the nation."
"On the same day, the town of Tanabe, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, which was renamed ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" through a municipal ordinance (city implementation), was renamed ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" to avoid duplication with Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture."
"Furthermore, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
It is renowned for its thriving tea (Uji tea) cultivation and boasts Gyokuro as a specialty product.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keahan Uji Bus (began operating in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city.
"Yamaki-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Also serves neighboring Tsuki County, Ide Town)"
"Kannonji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's major stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shintabata Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the centers of Kyotanabe city, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is also served by ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line.
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city's name around the same time the city was incorporated.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (on the Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of the former province name ""Kii"" in the station's name, located within Tanabe City, is likely to avoid name duplication with other stations under the management of West Japan Railway Company."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot located in the city)"

Musashi Province was one of the provinces in Japan's former administrative divisions.
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama and Tokyo east of the Sumida River excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, kokushi-koku (province) level classification, remote country."
Heian-kyo was the capital of Japan established by Emperor Kanmu in 794 (延暦13).
"Heian-kyō, located in present-day central Kyoto, Kyoto Prefecture, spanned the two counties of Kaga and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city, 4.5 km east-west and 5.2 km north-south."
"The Imperial Palace was to be established at the northernmost point of the capital, with Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing the city into the Left Capital (East) and Right Capital (West)."
The floor plan basically follows Heijo-kyo and imitates the Sui and Tang dynasties' Chang'an.
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this site was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony"", a principle derived from Feng Shui."
Heian-kyo was smaller than the current city of Kyoto.
"The northernmost street, Ichi-jo Oji, lies between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori, on Ichi-jo-dori."
"The ninth main road in the southernmost part is the current Kyogoku Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
"The easternmost road of Edo, Tokyo's main road, corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori."
The estimated location of Saigyo's Saikyokudai-ro is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Saikyokuguchi Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) on each side, defined by a network of large and small roads running north, south, east, and west."
"A row of four east-west aligned towns (excluding the two on the northern edge) is called a ""条,"" while a column of four north-south aligned towns is called a ""坊."""
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jūyonchō""."
"The width of roads was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for narrow alleys, and over 8 zhang (about 24 meters) for major roads."
Existing roads within Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
It was 28 zhang (about 84 meters) wide at Suzaku Avenue.
"Moreover, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishihorikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that this move was intended to establish a new capital for the Tenji Emperor lineage, breaking free from the Yamato province, where the power of nobles and temples supporting the Tenmu Emperor lineage had concentrated."
"However, just 10 years later, in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing the Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane tsugu in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sara, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyō."
The construction of Heian-kyō is thought to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and subsequently progressed to the construction of the capital city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of the Kamo River was located in a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), so urbanization did not progress even in the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system was largely a formality,  there was such devastation that farmland, which was forbidden within the capital, was even being converted for other uses."
"The residential areas for the nobility were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Kōki is an officially commissioned historical text compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the Six National Histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
The editors are Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in 819 AD, Emperor Saga commissioned藤原冬嗣,藤原緒嗣,藤原貞嗣, and 良岑安世 to compile the work."
"As the three remaining, except for Otsu, died without completing the task, Emperor Junwa later issued an order appointing Kiyohara Natsuyo, Prince Naoyo, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Ima-tsugi, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, another decree was issued, entrusting Fujiwara Tsugu, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori with the task of carrying it out."
"The project was finally completed on December 9th, Jōwa 7 (January 5th, 841), after the addition of Furutaka and Yamada Koshi."
"The compilation took 21 years, a project that spanned three reigns and was undertaken by Fujiwara no Osachi alone."
"Continuing after the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" this work records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, beginning midway through Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes until the early 15th century, the work subsequently dispersed.  It was only in the late 18th century that ten volumes were rediscovered in the Sanjo-nishi family by Inayama Gikyo, a pupil of the renowned scholar Hanafusa Hokiichi, leading to its first publication. (An alternative theory suggests that it was the revised edition by Yanagihara Kinmitsu which was rediscovered)."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kwanmu), 14 and 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, with a complete absence of volumes from the reign of Emperor Junna."
"Extracts from the ""Six Histories of Japan,"" like the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" and the categorized ""Six Histories"" of Japan, known as the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" can be used to reconstruct a significant portion of the original texts."
"There are ""Nihon Iti-shi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itibun"" which are collections of various historical anecdotes, and based on these, the following works have been published: Iwanami Shoten's ""Nihon Shiryo"" and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
It is said that the content most reflects Fujiwara no Osushi's opinions.
"Following the example of the *Shoku Nihongi*, the subsequent historical works included brief biographies (kōden) in death notices of emperors and court officials."
"However, this book's account of his death does not fall into the trap of one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but contains many interesting descriptions interwoven with unique criticism and reflections, making it distinctive among the Six Histories for its persistent critical spirit."
"It is also known that the Rikkokushi, compared to historical texts before and after it, included a large number of waka poems."
Sei Shonagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908 - 990), a renowned poet who was one of the Five Poets of the Pear Jar."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in the ""Goshūi Wakashū"" with ""Higaki no Ōna"", but it is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (or possibly grandfather according to some) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet in the Kokin Wakashu."
"Among the siblings, there is a woman who married the head of the Gagaku Bureau, Taira no Korenari, and also married the vice-minister of the Imperial Court, a Buddhist priest in the Imperial Palace, Kaisho, and also a woman who married Fujiwara no Norinaga (the brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shōnagon's given name is a combination of her family name, ""Kiyo"" (from the Kiyohara clan), and the title of her relative, ""Shōnagon."""
"The real name is unknown, although there is a theory (in ""Makura no Soshi"" - ""The Pillow Book"") that it was ""Nagiko"", but this is not reliable."
"Considered one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she is known for her small collection of 42 poems, *Sei Shonagon's Collection* (the number of poems varies depending on the version; the most widely circulated edition has 31)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū"", there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and final Shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, the daughter of Konoe Nobuhiro."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"Though initially a monk, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of the Shogun's retainers, including Hosokawa Yūsai, after Yoshiaki was assassinated by Matsuura Nagahisa."
"And, he ascended to Kyoto under the protection of Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, becoming the 15th shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle and besiege him."
"Though he once cornered Nobunaga, he was eventually driven from Kyoto by the warlord, effectively ending the Muromachi Shogunate."
He then lived out his remaining years with the assistance of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"He was born on November 13th, 1537, the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"He became the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin temple of Kofukuji), taking the name Kakkei, because his brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was the heir."
He later rose to the rank of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshihisa, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, while his younger brother, Ashikaga Chusoku, then head of the Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured and murdered."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofuku-ji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and his followers, fearing that making Kofuku-ji an enemy by killing Gakkan, who was the younger brother of the Shogun and had been promised the position of Abbot of Kofuku-ji in the future, opted to confine him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17th, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and assumed the name Yoshiteru."
"Books describing Yoshiaki refer to him by the alternate title, ""Buke Gosho."""
"When he was driven from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and is said to have been called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Jugoi no Ge, Sama no Kami."
"However, while there are questions regarding the date of his appointment, according to Sanjonin Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki,"" Tokitsugu, who was the envoy for the declaration of Yoshiie Ashikaga as shogun on February 11th, 1568, Yoshiaki's rival, records that Yoshiaki's envoy visited his residence on the day of the declaration and requested his assistance in securing a promotion to the rank of Jushi no ge. Tokitsugu expressed confusion, clearly indicating that Yoshiaki had already received the appointment before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshiteru initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku father and son, Yoshikatsu and Yoshiharu, in Omi Province. However, due to Yoshiharu's secret collusion with the Miyoshi Trio, Yoshiteru fled to his sister's husband, Yoshitaka Takeda of Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, due to internal conflicts, including disputes over the family headship and power struggles among senior vassals, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the strength to ascend to Kyoto. In September, they sought refuge with Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, requesting his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsuguji, a member of the Ashikaga shogunal family and resident of the ""Kuratani Palace,"" under his protection, and was not inclined to actively march on Kyoto with the recently-secularized Ashikaga Yoshiaki, thus the plan to ascend to the capital failed."
"The role of ""Kakan-yaku"" (the one who bestows the cap) was played by Asakura Yoshikage. (Note that there are no historical documents indicating Yoshiaki ever officially came of age. For his time, his Genpuku was considered extremely late.)"
"He would eventually move to Mino Province, relying on Oda Nobunaga, with the help of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior retainer of the Asakura family."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, supported by Oda Nobunaga."
He was appointed the 15th Shogun on October 18th by the Imperial Court.
"Simultaneously, they were promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the positions of Sangi, Left Division of the Inner Palace Guard, Middle General."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tōkaidō Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway for almost the entire distance, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is used."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is a main line alongside the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is directly used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka, covering 42.8 km along the right bank of the Yodo River, parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line, with the fastest journey time of 28 minutes (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
"All sections are double-double track, with separate tracks for each direction (outer and inner tracks)."
"All stations on the JR Kyoto Line accept J-Thru ICOCA, JR East Suica, JR Central TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI PiTaPa."
The Sanyo Line has implemented a new operation management system.
It operates as one with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"The station is served by local, rapid, and limited express trains, including direct services on the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and the Sanin region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR restructuring, sleeper express trains to Kyushu that had originated in Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula that had originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express trains that were introduced with the opening of the Chizu Express line, all began operating through to Kyoto, significantly increasing the frequency of express train services on this section."
"The Haruka, which began operating simultaneously with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains become regular services to Kyoto a year later. The New Osaka - Kyoto route, including other trains such as the Hokuriku Limited Express ""Thunderbird,"" now boasts a rush hour of four express trains or more."
"However, all sleeper trains running between Kyoto and Kyushu were abolished in the March 15, 2008, timetable revision."
"Downward express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that pass through Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka to the Hanwa Line enter Shin-Osaka via the freight line from Ibaraki Station (third departure), passing through Suita Signal Box."
"Therefore, the travel time is slightly longer than that of express or rapid trains that run on the outer lines in the same section, and in some time slots, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka Station simultaneously."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is exceptionally straight for almost its entire length, and the outer track is capable of 130km/h operation, except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling 120 km/h, but express trains never use it (except for empty trains or temporary services)."
The following express trains will operate on this section.
"In addition, transfer trains such as the ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin"" operate on this section for inbound and outbound traffic to Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Moreover, the return trains for ""Thunderbird"", ""Raicho"", and ""Kitaguni"" between Mukomachi and Osaka use the Kita Osaka Freight Line."
"When a train bound for Osaka is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds south from Osaka Station, passing through Tsukamoto Station, then enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used when it leaves the depot.)"
"Therefore, when running in and out of the station, the front and rear of the formation are reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs direct from JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Line Amigasaki, Joge, and Ako Line Banshu-Ako to JR Kyoto Line, then to Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From noon to night, there are departures every 15 minutes. In the afternoon, one train goes to the Kosei Line, while the other three run direct to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run directly to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains are operated using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, in 8-car or 12-car formations."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway (Kyoto Juukan Expressway) is a 100-kilometer-long high-standard highway (National Route 478) running from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City in the same prefecture."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which stretches long from north to south, it strengthens the connection between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, revitalizes the region, and also serves as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto Metropolitan Area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""Kyoto's backbone."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the middle, and the ending point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"", not ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway""."
"Moreover, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway is often used to refer only to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here and will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and Sanin Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and the passage of small vehicles, etc. is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation works are currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll Road Sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita-Honsen Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Ankokuji IC, so it's impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation is scheduled to manage the Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji section, which is expected to open around summer to fall 2008.  The Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation at the same time, resulting in the current free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT becoming a toll section."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and a new Ayabe Angokuji toll gate will be built."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. This eliminates all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway mainline.
The current Ayabe Kita-Honsen toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC - Kyotanba Wachi IC section is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an opening scheduled for fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after its opening remains uncertain."
"February 17, 1988: National Route 9, the Oinonosaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukari IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, and National Route 9, the Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Kutsugaki IC to Chiyogawa IC is reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) via the opening of the Ayabe JCT-Maizuru-Ooe IC (two-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, transferring ownership to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The portion where the background color of the IC Number column is ■ indicates sections of the road that have been put into service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate facilities that are not in use or incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is tentative.
MUJI is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the schedule number.
"Enryakuji Temple is located in Sakamotomotomachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, and encompasses the entire area of Mount Hiei, which stands at 848 meters above sea level."
"While it's officially known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei is often referred to as Hieizan or Eizan."
"It was also called Hokurei, as it lay to the north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto)."
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The abbot (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has stood alongside Koyasan Kongobu-ji Temple as a central pillar of Heian Buddhism."
"Besides the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, it also practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (Shikan), and Nembutsu, exhibiting the character of a comprehensive Buddhist university.  During the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the imperial family and nobility, attaining great influence."
"The esoteric practices of the esoteric sects, particularly their incantations and prayers, found favor with the Heian nobility. While the esoteric Buddhism of Toji temple, which belonged to the Shingon sect, became known as ""To-mitsu,"" the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Dai-mitsu,"" and the two competed for supremacy."
"Enryaku-ji is a collective term for the halls and pagodas of the three towers (Tōdō, Saitō, Yokawa) and sixteen valleys scattered throughout the precinct of Mount Hiei, from the summit down to the eastern foot."
It originated in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikanin.
"It was only in 824 AD, during the fourteenth year of the reign of Emperor Junna, after the death of Saicho, that the temple was permitted to adopt the name Enryaku-ji, which was taken from the era of its founding."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu,  Hōnen, the founder of Jōdo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jōdo Shinshū,  Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Sōtō Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism.  Many of these founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, leading it to be called the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei has frequently appeared in literary works.
"Furthermore, rigorous practices such as ""12 Years of Mountain Retreat"" and ""One Thousand Days of Peak Pilgrimage"" continue to this day, making this a prominent holy site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"" (Records of Ancient Matters), suggesting it was a mountain of Shinto worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto on the eastern foot of the mountain, Ōyamagui, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno Obito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingō era."
"At the age of fifteen, in 780 during the Jōkei era, he was ordained under the monk Gyōhyō of the Ōmi Kokubunji Temple, taking the name Saichō."
He received the precepts and became a fully ordained monk at the age of 20 in 785 at Tōdai-ji Temple in Nara.
"The young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, abandoned the stable position offered by the great temples of Nara and chose instead to devote himself to ascetic practices and scriptural studies in seclusion on Mount Hiei, near his homeland."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied ""The Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Commentary on the Meditation on Stopping and Contemplation"") written by Tiantai Master Zhiyi of China."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a sutra repository at the present location of the Hojo Konpon-chudo, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple, also known as Hieizan-ji, was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" taking the name of the era, only after the death of Saicho, in the year 824, during the Hongan era."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close advisors, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national protection site guarding the demon gate (northeast) of Kyoto."
"In 802 AD, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang China as a ""gengakusho"" (short-term overseas student)."
"He sailed to Tang Dynasty in 804, on a ship of the Japanese Imperial Envoy."
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai Buddhism and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai founder, Zhiyi, and learned Tendai Buddhism from Gyōman, the abbot."
"Moreover, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from Ajari Shunkyo at Ryukoji Temple in Koshi (Shaoxing) and Zen from Zen Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personified the moon and ruled the night, alternative theories exist (discussed below)."
It's also read as Tsukiyomi.
"While the Japanese Chronicles record the slaying of the food deity, generally considered a male deity, there is no description in the chronicles to definitively determine the deity's gender."
"Many lunar deities in other cultures are goddesses, and warlike goddesses also appear frequently in other mythologies.  Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god and support the theory of a female deity."
"Tsukiyomi, though considered a moon god, has different aspects depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed purification rites, and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye, Tsukiyomi, and from his nose, Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" unlike the ""Kojiki,"" there are accounts of him being born from the left eye, or emerging from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, and his dominion is also inconsistent, varying from the heavens to the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in contrast to Amaterasu, the sun goddess, reflects a common concept found in comparative mythology, where similar ideas appear across various mythologies."
"For example, the Chinese myth of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji"") states that Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon after his death. In Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also depicted as twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate deity from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one came later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, it is said that on the fourth day of creation, God made ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and the moon, and appointed them to rule over the day and night, dividing the light and darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can also be considered to follow the pattern of the universal myth of the Sun and Moon being born as a pair, a common motif found worldwide."
"Despite being an important deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi makes only limited appearances in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, and generally lacks significant actions."
Only a slight mention of the origins of grain can be found in the eleventh chapter of the fifth volume of the Nihon Shoki.
"There are also theories that suggest the inclusion of a god who does nothing, between the contrasting deities of Amaterasu and Susanoo, creates a balance."
"A similar structure is also found in other pairings, such as the relationship of Amenominakanushi to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, or Hosuseri to Hori (Yamasachihiko) and Hoder (Umisachihiko)."
This is called a hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some believe that Susanoo is the same god as [another deity], as their domains and episodes overlap in part."
"Born from Izanagi's right eye, they are known as the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo, as recounted in the first volume of the Kojiki."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""inform the land of night's food,"" but there is no further record of his activities."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"While the Fifth Section of the Kojiki's Age of the Gods simply states that the deity of the sun created a deity of the moon, whose radiance rivaled the sun's, and sent it to the heavens to rule alongside the sun, a different account in the First Book tells a different story. In this alternate version, Izanagi held a white copper mirror in his left hand when he gave birth to Ohirume, and a white copper mirror in his right hand when he gave birth to Tsukoyomi."
"While there are several accounts of Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside others, there is also a narrative where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" which seemingly derives from the idea that the moon controls tides.  These accounts of the birth of the three gods coexist in parallel."
"In the fifth chapter, eleventh book of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukuyomi was commanded by Amaterasu to descend from the heavens to meet Uke Mochi (the food goddess) on earth."
"There is a myth that the food goddess, in an act of hospitality, vomited food from her mouth, causing the moon god to be disgusted and kill her with his sword."
"The body of the food deity gave birth to cattle, horses, silkworms, rice, and other grains, which became the origin of all crops."
"Onmyōji was a government position in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system, belonging to the Yin-Yang Bureau under the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"The office assigned to practitioners who performed divination, geomancy, and other techniques based on Yin-Yang and Five Elements principles, who eventually expanded their role beyond the original legal regulations to oversee all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"After the medieval period, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various locations. In modern times, it is defined as a type of clergy who perform private prayers and divination in the public domain."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyoji"" without the sound change."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, originating in ancient China during the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and reaching near completion during the Zhou dynasty, along with its close associations in astronomy, calendar, Yi (Book of Changes), and timekeeping, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han, Sui) or indirectly via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo, Baekje) to Japan by the 5th or 6th century, during the Asuka period. At the latest, this transmission occurred by 512 AD (year 7 of Emperor Keitai) with the arrival of Five Classics scholars from Baekje, or by 554 AD (year 15 of Emperor Kinmei) with the arrival of Yi scholars."
"While these studies initially had little impact on politics and culture, the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje in 602 CE, who became the pioneer of Onmyōdō in Japan, led to a significant influence on national affairs when he lectured 34 select officials, including Prince Shotoku, on various subjects."
"For the first time in Japan, the Yuanjia Calendar was adopted as the official calendar. In 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), envoys were sent to Sui, a leading civilization, to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods. The influence of this philosophy was also prominent in the Seventeen-Article Constitution and the establishment of the twelve-rank cap and robe system by Prince Shotoku."
"Even afterwards, the court continued to send students with envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the western coast of the Korean Peninsula where they made port, further striving to absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became crucial to understand the movements and positions of the sun, moon, and stars, and to interpret their implications for fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the five elements (yin-yang and five elements philosophy). This led to the prominence of the yin-yang and five elements philosophy as a means to discern auspicious and inauspicious events and establish guidelines for conduct."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, known for his mastery of divination and Yin-Yang Five Elements theory, established the ""Yin-Yang Office"" and Japan's first observatory in 676 AD (the 4th year of his reign). He even used divination sticks during the Jinshin War."
"The use of the term ""Onmyoji"" began in 685 AD (13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), marking the further rise of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought.  In 718, the Yōrō Code officially established the Onmyōryō (Bureau of Yin-Yang) as an inner department of the Ministry of Central Affairs,  mandating permanent appointments for Astronomical Doctors, Yin-Yang Doctors, Onmyoji, Calendar Doctors, and Clepsydra Doctors.  This officially recognized the Bureau as a government institution responsible for divination alongside the shrine officials'龜卜 (turtle-shell divination)."
"Only the specialists in techniques transmitted from the mainland were entrusted with these tasks. Each doctor and Onmyoji was appointed from among those who returned from the mainland, specifically those who were well-versed in various fields of learning and proficient in reading Chinese texts. These included immigrants from the former Han Dynasty, the Later Han Dynasty, the Sui Dynasty which took over as the dominant force on the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and, rarely, scholars who returned from Silla, initially a force on the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly, in the aftermath of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 (Tenchi 2), where Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, leading to Baekje's defeat and the unification of the Korean peninsula by Silla, a large number of intellectuals fled Baekje and came to Japan as refugees. Many of them were appointed to official positions."
"In its initial establishment, the Yin-Yang Office solely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern Feng Shui), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the operation of clepsydras.  Its duties were limited to predicting the future through theoretical analysis based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, managing astronomical observation and timekeeping.  Unlike Shinto priests or Buddhist monks, the Office did not engage in religious ceremonies or magic.  However, it played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial court and determining the auspiciousness of land and directions, making it essential in relocation decisions, such as during the relocation of the capital."

"An office that oversees the Yin Yang Office, supervising all aspects of astronomy, calendars, weather patterns, and signs, sealing and secretly reporting any anomalies without letting them out, presenting the calendar created by the calendar doctor to the emperor by November 1st each year, and reporting the results of divination and geomancy as needed."
