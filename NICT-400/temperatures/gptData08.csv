"Waseda University and Keio University, along with their educational corporations, are among the top educational institutions in Japan."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is the ""conscience"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Shinshiro Toshimaro aimed to cultivate individuals who could ""utilize their conscience in their actions"" as the purpose of education."
"I wanted to produce people who are ""filled with conscience in their whole body"" by promoting ""character education"" based on Christianity in parallel so as not to be biased towards knowledge education."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting expressing those thoughts exist at various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May the spirit of righteousness pervade the whole body and bring forth a strong and healthy moral character"" are engraved on this monument of conscience."
"Furthermore, as an educational philosophy to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
It is a Protestant Christian school corporation that follows the congregational church (union church).
"However, unlike so-called mission-based universities, it does not have the primary purpose of Christian evangelism (and does not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."
"This is a school corporation that was established by one of the six great educators of the Meiji era in 1875, Shinshu New Island, based on the Doshisha English School."

"Regarding ""Ikyū-san no Tonchi Banashi,"" please refer to the section on ""Ikyū Banashi"" (there is also some description on this page). For the TV anime ""Ikyū-san,"" please refer to the section on ""Ikyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara no Nagahisa, there is a passage on August 1, 1494, which says, ""It is said in secret that Ikkyu Sojun is a prince descended from Go-Komatsu-in."""
There is no one in the world who knows.
"The childhood name was Chigikumaru, according to later historical records."
"He became known as Zhou Jian, and took on aliases such as Kuang Yunzi, Xia Lu, and Mu Kei."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shunjyun, also written as Shunjun."
Ikkyu is a temple name.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist name"" section for information on posthumous Buddhist names and temple names."
"At the age of six, he entered the Zen school of Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and received the precepts, being given the name Shuken."
"From an early age, he excelled in poetry, and his Chinese poems ""Nagato Spring Grass,"" composed at the age of 13, and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Flowers,"" composed at the age of 15, were highly praised and acclaimed in the capital city of Kyoto."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and changed his Buddhist name to Sōjun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's actions were due to his master's passing, but he is attempting suicide."
"He became a disciple of Kaso Sodon, a high priest at Daikakuji Temple in Kyoto, in the 22nd year of the Oei era (1415)."
"He received the religious name ""Ikkyu"" from Kaso for answering the case of ""The Stick of Dongshan Thrice Struck"" with the words: ""From existence to non-existence, taking a rest; when it rains, let it rain; when the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Arroji (world of delusion)"" refers to the world of cravings and desires, while ""muroji (world of enlightenment)"" refers to the world of awakening and enlightenment."
"One night in the 27th year of Ōei (1420), upon hearing the cries of crows, I suddenly came to a great realization."
"The elderly man tries to give the seal of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"It is said that the old man sent him off with a laugh, calling him a fool."
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, craziness, calligraphy, and painting."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Go-Komatsu passed away without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi branch succeeded to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the ascension of Emperor Go-Hanazono.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the East Sea""."
"However, Imazumi Yoshio argues that the accession of Emperor Go-Kameyama was approved by the shogunate, and was not related to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of Bunmei (1474), after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the chief priest of Daitoku-ji Temple (47th generation) by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and although he did not reside in the temple, he worked tirelessly for its revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"As a result of the Meiji Restoration in Tokyo, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace (formerly Edo Castle), which was preserved in 1877."
"After the Meiji period, it was also referred to as the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the formal Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of the city, but it was moved to the Rikyu Palace due to damage caused by wars and other conflicts."
"The Togu Palace of the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in Palace was one of the Imperial Palaces in this area, where the Emperor's family of the Jomyo-in line, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which is called the Southern Court, was located in Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the former Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in, but an expansion based on the Tsuchimikado Higashidono-in."
"Normally, you can visit by applying, and it is also open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the imperial visit to Tokyo in the second year of Meiji (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is a national property classified as ""Imperial property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, and across from Imadegawa Street to the north is Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both campuses located at Imadegawa)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Sento Imperial Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Kyoto residents often simply call it ""Gosho,"" including Kyoto Gyoen."
"However, unlike overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. Some suggest that this difference reflects the varying levels of familiarity between commoners and rulers in the East and the West (Emperor and other imperial family members)."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, which was the residence of the ruler (king). The fact that such incidents have not occurred in Japan is one of the bases for this kind of analysis."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located significantly to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the JR Nijo Station in Kyoto."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the retired Emperor, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashidono. It was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of the Genko era (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was here was rebuilt eight times just in the Edo period (six of which were rebuilt due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855), following the Heian style, and is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of Meiji (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deterioration of the Kyoto Imperial Palace within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"The main buildings include the Shishin-den, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Ozusumisho, and the Empress's residence."
"The Ceremony of Enthronement has always been held at the Shishin-den in the Kyoto Imperial Palace from generation to generation. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the old Imperial Household Law established in 1889 (Meiji 22), it was stipulated that the Ceremony of Enthronement and the Daijosai Ceremony should be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also conducted their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"In addition, there is no specific provision in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II that the enthronement ceremony must be held in Kyoto. In 1990, for the first time in history, the Enthronement Ceremony of the current Emperor was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"At the time of enthronement, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing his enthronement, located in the Shishin-den Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Sokuirei-Seiden-no-Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishin-den-no-Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"It is a four-legged gate with a plain wooden structure, gabled roof, cedar bark thatching, and a pillar spacing of one bay."
"The gate is opened only for special events such as the Emperor and VIPs visiting, as well as for public viewing."
"The walls on the left and right of the Tsukiji fence have five lines (horizontal lines) in them, which also represent the highest status as a fence."
"Upon passing through this gate and under the vermillion-tiled Seihei-mon gate, you will see the Shikun-den Palace directly ahead."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following describes Japanese gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Club (Important Intangible Cultural Asset).
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency's Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, it refers to the repertoire played by the Imperial Household Agency's Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, excluding Western music."
Many are inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the oldest style in the world as traditional music played in large-scale ensemble form even now.
"However, as a form of ensemble music, Gagaku had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate reorganized it by gathering descendants of musicians (Gakka). Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period's form has been inherited."
"When singing a score written in katakana for the shōga melody of the hichiriki, it is speculated that the pronunciation of the h-row as fa fi fu fe fo, among other features of the pronunciation of Japanese before the 16th century, is faithfully reproduced, suggesting that the overall rendition is quite accurate."
"Things written in kanji, like the notation of the Raku Biwa, bear many similarities to the Biwa notation discovered in Dunhuang, China, and many styles handed down from an even older continent are further inherited."
"One of the most important historical sources is the ""Taigen Shō"" written by Toyohara Noritsugu (1450-1512) out of concern that records such as gagaku music were being lost during the Ōnin War."
"""Tsunaaki, the head of the shō household, compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku centered around the shō, which is a valuable record of ancient gagaku."""
"The music for rituals that originated from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the songs currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have originated from China, is said to be based on the music performed at a Tang banquet called Yan Yue."
"As a category of music, various international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and music from Lin Yi (Champa) have been passed down, including elements of ancient Japanese music from before the arrival of music from the continent."
"Before modern times, the three main music halls that were known for preserving the oldest styles were the Tennoji Gakuso at Shitennoji Temple in Osaka, the Dainai Gakuso in the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, and the Nanto Gakuso at Kasuga Shrine in Nara."
"These music schools were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each music school continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, there is mutual influence between folk songs and statements, and Japan's unique style has been created."
"Currently, around 100 pieces have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Gagaku Department."
Refer to the lyrics of S-style song and dance.
Items brought from outside Japan (some consider only these to be gagaku.)
"Left-side dance and Tang music..... of Chinese, Indian, and Lin Yi (Southern Vietnam) descent."
"Right Dance - Goryeo Music..... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) lineage"
These include songs produced in Japan imitating the above-mentioned style (Japanese music) as well.
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period.
Refer to the lyrics of the song.
There are cases where Gufu Kagubu and yobutsu are collectively referred to as ancient songs.
"Emperor Kanmu (737 - April 9, 806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan."
Emperor Kanmu was born in the 9th year of Tenpyo (737) as the first son of Prince Shirabe (later known as Emperor Kōnin).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shin-gasa, the mother, is recorded as a descendant of the Baekje royal family, whose ancestor is King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince Yasuhori (later Emperor Heijō), Empress Kanō (later Empress Saga) gave birth to Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, the low-status background of his mother, Takano Shinkasa, who belonged to the immigrant clan Waishi, made it undesirable for him to be named Crown Prince. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat and held positions such as Chamberlain, Chief Scholar, and Minister of the Center."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and the younger half-brother was made Crown Prince on January 2nd, 773."
"In order to avoid the excessive influence of the various Nara Buddhist temples in Heijo-kyo, the capital was relocated to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built again."
"To invade the Tohoku region and bring the Emishi under control, a military force led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro was sent."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Fujiwara Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara clan for causing such military actions and construction to burden the peasants."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought a new movement to Japanese Buddhism under the reign of Emperor Kammu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Hota, as well as the dark aspect of sentencing Prince Hayara to exile in 785 for the assassination of Fujiwara Tanetsugu at the beginning of his reign and causing his death at the place of exile, were also part of his reign."
"Out of fear of the vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Kammu posthumously honored Prince Sawara as Emperor Sudo, designated Princess Inoe's grave as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the guardians of Saicho and Kukai, on the other hand, they have put pressure on various factions known as the ""Nanto Rokushu"" by confiscating their fiefs due to the excessive power of existing Buddhism involved in the government."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident at the Yatsumi Palace""."
"He passed away on March 17, 806 in the 25th year of Enryaku."
"Emperor Jimmu, who was given the posthumous name Yamato Takeru Ikazuchi Iyatsukihime no Mikoto, established the foundation of Japan."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given the Chinese-style temple name."
"Emperor Kashiwabara, also known as Emperor Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he had insisted on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was laid to rest at Fushimi's Kashihara Mausoleum."
"With the start of the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in one of the three Imperial Palace sanctuaries, the Ko-reiden."
"On December 18, 2001, during the customary press conference held before the Emperor's birthday, Akihito made a statement regarding the upcoming joint hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea due to the fact that the mother of Emperor Kanmu is recorded in the Nihon Shoki as being a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"While this statement was not widely covered in Japan, it received significant attention in the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"Some have gone so far as to make huge leaps in logic, claiming that the Imperial Family has Korean lineage, promoting theories such as the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory."""
"The Otani family (Otani-ke) is the family name of the descendants of Kakue, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a lower-ranking noble in Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest of Hongan-ji, the main temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"When the practice of using surnames became necessary during the Meiji era, both the head of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head of the Jodo Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo), which split in 1602, adopted their respective sect names as their surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the fact that the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, was established at the Otani location north of the Chion-in North Gate in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Honpouji was considered one of the daimyo of the Warring States period in Japan due to its power aligning with the spread of the Ikko Ikki movement, and sometimes it is referred to with the honorific title of the head priest's Buddhist name (Jodo Shinshu) or with ""Honpouji"" added to their given name, such as ""Honpouji Kenyo"" or ""Honpouji Kosuke."" However, this is only for convenience and does not mean that the head priest's family lineage made Honpouji their family name or surname, nor does it mean that there was a Honpouji clan."
"Kakushinji watched over Shinran as he passed away in 1262, and in 1272 he built a hall in Otani near his own home in the eastern mountains of Kyoto to enshrine Shinran's remains."
"Daibutsudou was established as a mausoleum for Shinran, attracting the reverence of followers of Jodo Shinshu. Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was appointed as the steward to oversee its management in his absence."
"However, the Otani Mausoleum later became a source of conflict between Kakuo's son Kakunyo and his half-brother Yoshizen over the position of head priest, as they competed to attract followers and donations from various regions. Kakunyo eventually emerged victorious and successfully established the hereditary succession of the head priest position within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Jodo Shinshu sect."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Honganji Temple and advanced the formation of the sect. By the time of the 5th generation, Jitsunyo, in the Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple expanded to the Hokuriku region. By the time of the 7th generation, Sonnyo, the Honganji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been striving to form a religious organization since the death of Shinran, the formation of the religious organization was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a sub-temple of Seirian-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, through the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, the Hongan-ji sect spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Hongan-ji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, due to the expansion of the teachings of Rennyo, the Ikko Ikki uprising occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Tomigashi clan by the Honganji sect in Kaga. This led to the creation of a situation known as the ""country governed by peasants."""
"For approximately a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from small farmers, utilized its organizational power to expand its activities throughout Japan, reaching the warrior class such as samurais and local lords. However, in 1532, during the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered damage from the war, leading the 10th head, Shonyo, to relocate to the Ishiyama Gobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), and established it as the Ishiyama Honganji temple."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
The key point of river transportation at the mouth of the Yodo River was dominated by Osaka.
"Establishing Ishiyama Hongan-ji as his base, Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, thereby solidifying the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the late Edo period, in local Jodo Shinshu sects such as those in Hokuriku, some began to stray from the control of the Honzan and follow their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head priest Kenju of the Shonin school, the Honganji sect had effectively become an independent daimyo power. They expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who was trying to establish unified control by taking away feudal power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Honganji temple and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the fortified Ishiyama Honganji held by Kennyo and the Honganji followers who carried out resistance movements against the Oda clan in various locations. Through their collaboration, the Honganji temple gained the upper hand and greatly troubled Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Gansho-ji temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikkō Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with Hongan-ji, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, marking another defeat for Hongan-ji outside of its own territory."
"While Ishiyama Hongan-ji maintained its strength by gathering support from the Iga clan and others, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally surrendered to Nobunaga, who had obtained a decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The power of Ishiyama Hongan-ji as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, the eldest son Kyonyobo and Kenyo, who continued to resist against Kenyo's intentions, argued, and when Kenyo passed away in 1593, his third son Junryo was chosen as his successor."
"From this point on, Hongan-ji began to split over the position of the gatekeeper, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu gave a separate temple ground to Kyonyo under Kyojo of Hongan-ji and established Higashi Hongan-ji."
"At this time, many followers from the Jodo sect, which became Nishi Honganji under Junjo, moved to the guidance of Kyonyo at Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into East and West."
"Originally, Shinran, the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the heads of the Eastern and Western Tani families, who traced their lineage back to Hino Hirotsun (the father of Kakunyo), had the custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles for generations, and they also continued to intermarry with court nobles, leading to the advancement of their status as court nobles through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is a city located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyotanabe City is located in the central part of the triangle area of three prefectures, Kyoto Prefecture in the south, Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Sagara District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"The Kizu River flows north and south along the eastern side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while the city is sandwiched between the Nara mountain range on the west side. The central area is served by the West Japan Railway Company's Karasuma Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kinki Nippon Railway."
"The character of Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City is strong as a bedroom community."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District became a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, the city of Hachiman was established for the first time in 20 years, as the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho in Tsuzuki-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, was renamed to ""Kyoto-fu Tanabe City"" by adding ""Kyoto"" to it, and the town was upgraded to a city (enactment of city system). On the same day, the city name change was also implemented to rename ""Kyoto-fu Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto-fu Kyoto Tanabe City""."
The new city name was selected through a general public offering.

"Kintetsu Shindenba Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line local trains run up to Kintetsu Nara Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and was renamed to match the city name around the time of its municipal designation."
This is the same case as Nishimuko Station and Higashimuko Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the name ""Kii"" from Wakayama Prefecture's old province name is included in the name of the station in Tanabe City to avoid duplication of station names within the same West Japan Railway Company network."

Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan in the year 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kammu.
"Heian-kyo was built in the area that now corresponds to the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanning the Katsuno District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province. It was a city that was laid out in a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east to west and 5.2km north to south."
"Establishing the Daijō-kyū at the northern center of the capital, and laying out the Suzaku Avenue from there to the center of the city, placing the Ukyo on the left and the Sakyo on the right (the eastern side is the Ukyo, and the western side is the Sakyo)."
"The layout plan basically follows the Heian-kyo, imitating the layout of Sui and Tang Dynasty's Chang'an."
"However, there were no walls around the city."
There is a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to feng shui that was transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The main road of the northern boundary is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
The southern boundary of Kujo Oji is Kujo-dori slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station.
The Tozai Gate of Tokyo's largest road corresponds to the present Teramachi Street.
"The estimated location of Saihigashi Saiinkyojimichi is a line connecting JR West San'in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station, running north-south."
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring 40 jo (approximately 120m) on each side, running east to west and north to south."
"Four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows at the northern edge) are called ""jo,"" and four rows lined up in the north-south direction are called ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same district had a number assigned to them.
"As a result, each town was called as ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho""."
The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12m) on small roads and at least 8 zhang (about 24m) on major roads.
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"When it reached Suzaku Avenue, it had a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-Horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa, Nishi-Horikawa) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and established the city of Nagaoka-kyo.
"However, it is said that there was an intention to move away from the power of the nobles and temples that had supported the reign of Emperor Tenmu and gather in Yamato Province, and to establish a new capital for Emperor Tenchi's lineage."
"However, in the year 794, just 10 years later, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This re-relocation of the capital is believed to be influenced by a series of incidents leading from the assassination of Fujiwara Taneetsugu in Nagaoka-kyo to the abdication of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the construction of the Imperial Palace (Dairi), followed by the construction of the city (urban area)."
"However, due to the wetland formed by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), the area of Ukyo did not develop into residential land even by the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become a mere formality, there were cases where land was converted to agricultural use, even though it was prohibited within the capital."
"Except for the northern part of the capital on the right side, the residential areas of the nobles were established in the left side of the capital, near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is an official history book compiled in the early Heian period, and is the third of the Rikkokushi following the Nihon Shoki."
It was completed in the 7th year of the Jōwa era (840) in Japan and covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tenchō era (833).
The editors are Fujiwara Shoshi and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Osutsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the book."
"Due to the deaths of three other individuals besides Koetsu leaving the matter unresolved, Emperor Junna later issued a decree ordering Kiyohara Natsuno, Prince Naosuke, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mimori, Sakagami Imotsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue on."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyō, further decrees were issued, ordering Fujiwara no Otsugu, Minamoto Tsunenori, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Kadori to carry out their duties."
"Furthermore, on December 9th of the 7th year of the Jōwa era (January 5th, 841), they reported the completion by adding Furutakaniwa and Yamada Furu."
"The period it took to compile was 21 years, and the only one who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Tsugunobu."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text continues with the reigns of Emperor Kanmu, Emperor Heizei, and Emperor Junna."
"Around the beginning of the 15th century, there were 40 volumes of the text, but they were later scattered. It was not until the disciple of Hani Hoami, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjo Nishi family's residence that it was first published. (There is also an alternative theory of a revised edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu.)"
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, and the era of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to partially reconstruct the text from the excerpted version of the ""Nihonki Ryaku"" and the classification of the topics in the ""Ruiju Kokushi"" from the six national histories."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Ibun"" which collect various excerpts from different places, and based on these, the following Shueisha translations and Kodansha Academic Bunko editions of Japanese historical materials have been published."
It is said that Fujiwara no Noritoshi's opinion was most reflected in the content.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the articles about the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Nihon Shoki,"" and is consistent with later historical books."
"However, the obituary in this book does not flow into unilateral and official praise or criticism, but rather includes many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and impressions, making it unique in the Six National Histories as it maintains a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi included more waka poems compared to other historical records before and after.
Sei Shonagon (around 966 – around 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"She was the daughter of Seiwa Genji, a famous poet and one of the Five Pear Jars."
"There is a tradition that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a fanciful and baseless theory."
"Great-great-grandfather (or great-grandfather, according to some theories) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"Among the brothers and sisters are a woman who became the wife of Gagaku head Tamenari, Assistant Inspector Dazai, Court Priest Kaishu of Hanayama-in, and Fujiwara Masaru (the brother of Fujiwara Michitsuna's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a pseudonym, with ""Sei"" being taken from her family name, Sei no Ue, and ""Shonagon"" taken from a court position held by her relatives."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Sho""), but it is not reliable to believe."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection ""Kiyoshinagono Collection"" consists of 42 short poems (the number of poems varies in different versions, with 31 poems in the circulated version)."
"""Koshiji Wakashu"" includes 14 poems in the Imperial Anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father is Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Mother is the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi, Keijuin."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a paternal half-brother."
"He originally belonged to the Buddhist clergy, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the assistance of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and went up to the capital, becoming the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga, and together with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, they built a siege network against Nobunaga."
"At one point, they had cornered Nobunaga, but eventually he expelled them from Kyoto, effectively destroying the Muromachi shogunate."
"After that, he received assistance from Motonari Mōri, and then spent his remaining years with the support of Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, in the sixth year of the Tenbun era, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was a younger brother named Ashikaga Yoshiteru who was the heir, he became the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisatsugu, and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofuku-ji Ichijo-in), taking the name Kakukyo."
He later advanced to the position of Gonshosozu at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th shogun, my brother Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Triumvirate, and my younger brother, Ashikaga Masanaga, who was the head priest of the Rakuan-in Temple, was also lured into his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and was imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple (Hisahide and others feared turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as Yoshiaki was the shogun's younger brother and was promised the position of head priest of Kofukuji Temple in the future)."
"However, he was helped to escape by vassals Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Yoshimasa, and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In the book that recorded the life of Yoshiaki, it is mentioned that he was also known as the warrior's residence."
"When he was expelled from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also called the ""Poor Governor."""
"On April 21st, he was quietly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and appointed as Left Head of the Cavalry."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to the ""Genkeikōki"" by Yamashina Genkei, it is clear that before this, he had already received the appointment. According to the ""Genkeikōki,"" on the day of the appointment of the shogun to Ashikaga Yoshihide, who was a contender to Yoshiaki in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), an envoy of Yoshiaki appeared at Genkei's residence, who was the envoy of the appointment, asking for mediation for promotion to Jushiishita. Yoshiaki's messenger was confused by this request."
"Yoshiaki, who escaped from Kyoto, initially relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshiyoshi and Rokkaku Yoshiharu, in Omi Province. However, Yoshiharu secretly conspired with the Sanjo Trio, so in August he fled to the territory of Takeda Yoshitsugu, his sister's husband in Wakasa Province."
"However, in the Wakasa Takeda clan, due to struggles for succession and power struggles among senior vassals, they lacked the ability to go up to the capital, and in September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking assistance in the restoration of the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage did not have the intention to actively go up to the capital because he already had the ""Kuragate Palace"" of the Ashikaga Shogun family branch, Ashikaga Tsugutomo, and accompanied Ashikaga Yoshiaki who had just returned to secular life, so the going up to the capital was not realized."
"The role of ""Kanmuriyaku"" is held by Yoshikage Asakura (Note that there is no official historical record of Yoshiteru's coming of age ceremony up to this point, making it unusually late for the time)."
"Eventually, under the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, I moved to Mino Province and relied on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the imperial court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Jushi-shi (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade) and appointed as Sangi (Councillor) and Left Guard General."
The JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto-sen) is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the Tokaido Main Line of West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"The Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway in almost all sections, and also connects to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is added to the line."
"The line color is blue (■), and because it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in the shortest time of 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8 km (maximum speed is 130 km/h)."
"It is a double-track line in both directions along the entire section (outer track, inner track)."
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J Through ICOCA, Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system is implemented on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that directly connect to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan-Hanshin Local Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and San'in region."
"Furthermore, nearly half of the local trains will also stop at Fukuchiyama Line's Shin-Sanda Station."
"After JR was established, sleeper limited express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains heading to the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuho"" train to the Sanin region which started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express, began to run directly to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating simultaneously with the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running to Kyoto as regular trains within a year, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Thunderbird limited express train heading towards the Hokuriku region."
"In addition, the sleeper express trains departing from Kyoto to Kyushu were completely discontinued in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" bound for the Nankai Line from Shin-Osaka enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (departing from platform 3) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the limited express and rapid trains that run on the outer track take slightly longer than the same section, and depending on the time of day, there may be times when two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The track alignment along almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line is extremely good, allowing speeds of up to 130km/h on the outer tracks, except for some curved sections."
"The inner line is also compatible with speeds of up to 120 km/h, but express trains never run on the inner line (except for transfer or special trains)."
The limited express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, in relation to the inbound and outbound operations at Mukaijima Town (Kyoto Comprehensive Operations Depot), transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train),"" ""Tanba (train),"" and ""Hokukinki (train)"" run on this section."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohachi and Osaka on the ""Thunderbird"" and ""Raicho"" services will pass through the Hokuhoku Freight Line."
"When bringing the down Osaka-bound train to the Kyoto General Operations Center for storage, proceed in the down direction from Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, when running in and out of the warehouse, the front and back of the train are reversed."
"Shin-Kaisoku operates direct services from the JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Ako, Kamigori, and Akaho Line towards the JR Kyoto Line, passing through the Biwako Line, Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line, and Omi-Shiotsu Station, all the way to Tsuruga."
"From daytime to night, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Kosai Line in the direction of Kyoto, while the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four trains at night run directly to the Biwako Line.
Operated with 8 or 12 car formations using the JR West Japan 223 series electric trains 1000 and 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100 km, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"The long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture runs through it, strengthening cooperation between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture to revitalize the region, while also serving as the southern outer ring road for the vulnerable high-standard road network of the Kyoto city metropolitan area."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""spine of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three locations, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, with the starting point side operating under the name of the Kyoto-Joto Bypass, rather than the Kyoto Jukando Expressway."
"In general, the Kyoto Tamba Road is often referred to as the Kyoto Vertical Highway."
"The main line section on the Miyatsu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"The section between Kume Yama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a national highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage of small vehicles such as motorcycles is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5 meters are unable to pass.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Public Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamotosen tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to only drive through the toll-free section."
"The Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji IC section, which is scheduled to open around the summer to autumn of 2008, will be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current toll-free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be tolled."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and the Ayabe Angu-ji toll booth will be newly established."
"Currently, Ayabe Ankokuji IC does not have a toll booth, so there are no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is constructed in a way that is close to a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyo-Tanba-Wachi IC is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and is scheduled to open in the 2014 fiscal year, but the management system after the opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinokanzaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a temporarily free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatagu IC to Chiyogawa IC is changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: The Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opens as a toll road for general use."
"March 8, 1998: Connection established between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru Oe IC with the opening of Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (provisional two-lane opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: Privatization of four road-related public corporations transferred ownership to the Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Agency, and management to NEXCO West Japan."
The area with a ■ background color in the IC number field indicates the section where the road is already in use.
"In addition, sections with a background color of ■ in the facility name field indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the unopened section is tentative.
Muji has no bullshit.
（数字） is the number of another route.
<Number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei at an elevation of 848 meters as its precincts."
"From the name of Enryaku-ji Temple to Mount Hiei, it is often referred to as Hiei (Eizan)."
It was located to the north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the branch temples.
"Since the founding of Saicho, it has been one of the centers of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (shikan), and chanting of the nembutsu were also practiced, presenting the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great power and earned the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the ritual of empowerment prayer through Esoteric Buddhism gained the support of the aristocracy in the Heian period, and the Esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple competed for supremacy against the Esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple within the Shingon sect."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the total of three towers and sixteen valleys, including the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokogawa, scattered within the precincts of Mount Hiei from the summit to the eastern foot."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikanin in Mt. Hiei, which marked the beginning."
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, taken from the era name at its founding, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the passing of Saichō."
"Enryakuji Temple has produced many famous monks and laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, including Ennin, Enchin, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu school, Shinran, the founder of Pure Land Buddhism, Hōnen, the founder of Jodo Shu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many of the founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history practiced at Mount Hiei in their youth, earning the temple the nickname of ""the mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and the ""1000-day Circumambulation of Peaks"" have been continued to the present day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and also registered as a World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the Kojiki, and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. In the Higashiyama foothills in Sakamoto, there is a shrine called Hiyoshi Taisha where the local deity of Mount Hiei, Oyama no Okami, is enshrined."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobu Hiro-no, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the 11th year of Hoki (780), he was ordained under the monk Gyoho at the Jogan-ji Temple in Omi Province and took the name Saicho."
"At the age of 20 in the fourth year of Enryaku (785), he received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became an official monk."
"Young En no Ozumi, for personal reasons, did not seek a stable position at a major temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei near his hometown, dedicating himself to training and studying scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the numerous scriptures, and he studied the ""Three Great Commentaries on the Lotus Sutra"" by the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi (""Hokke Gengi,"" ""Hokke Mongu,"" ""Maka Shikan"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, Monju Hall, and Sutra Repository at the current location of the Konpon Chudo and named it Ichijo Shikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"During the time of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho became a disciple and received support from the Emperor and the influential Waki clan. As a result, Mount Hiei Temple gradually prospered as a dojo for national protection, guarding the northeastern direction of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of the Enryaku era (802), Saicho was allowed to travel to Tang China as a returning student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of the Enryaku era (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a ship as part of a diplomatic mission."
"Enchin went to the sacred site of Mount Hiei and learned Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from Dojo, a direct disciple of the great Tendai master Zhiyi."
"Furthermore, at the Longxing Temple in Yue State (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
It is said to have been created by Izanagi in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki.
"It is considered that he is a god who deifies the moon in a normal way and rules over the night, but there are also other theories (mentioned later)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Kojiki about Yasakatsumi being killed, so although generally considered a male god, there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and in other countries' myths, goddesses with more aggressive personalities also frequently appear. Therefore, some scholars argue for a goddess theory, as it is not conclusive that the story of Yasakani no Magatama's murder involves a male god."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and purified himself, along with Amaterasu, born from his other eye, and Susanoo, born from his nose, forming the three noble children."
"On the other hand, the Nihon Shoki tells a story that Amaterasu was born from her left eye, in contrast to the Kojiki, and also mentions a story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, with her dominion not being limited to just the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born as a pair with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Records of the Grand Historian""), there is a creation myth that Pangu died and his left eye became the sun, while his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are also considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later times that they were identified as the same."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation of heaven and earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to govern day and night respectively, and separated light from darkness, telling of the creation of the sun and moon."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common world myth of the origin of the sun and moon being born as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, yet he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally not very active."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the ""Nihon Shoki"" Section Five, Verse Eleven, that the origins of grains are being discussed."
There is a theory that balance is maintained by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of the gods Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in the relationship between Amaterasu-ōmikami and Takamimusubi, as well as between Hoori (Yamasachihiko) and Hoderi (Umisachihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some believe in the theory of the same god because the dominions and episodes of Susanoo overlap in some parts.
"In the first volume of the ""Kojiki,"" he was born when he washed the right eye of Izanagi no Mikoto, and was called one of the ""three precious children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto was ordered to ""inform the land of night eating,"" but there was no further activity."
There is also a theory that it is the country of Yomimi where the god Izanami resides.
"In the fifth section of the Kamiyo no Kiki in the Nihon Shoki, it is briefly stated that ""a god of the moon, shining brightly next to the sun, was born and sent to heaven to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first section, there is a different account where Izanagi no Mikoto gave birth to Oho-namuchi no Mikoto while holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to Tsukuyomi no Mikoto while holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu Ōmikami in the domain of domination, while there is also a story about being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tide of the Canghain Plain (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), and multiple tales of the birth of the three gods are parallel."
"In the fifth paragraph of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule over the heavens together. However, later Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was commanded to descend to meet the god of food (Ukemochi) in the heavens."
"In response, the god of food, Hojoshin, served food from his mouth, but Tsukiyomimi no mikoto became angry and struck and killed Hojoshin with a sword, saying it was disgusting."
"From the dead body of the god of food, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, and other things were born, and this became the origin of grain."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions belonging to the Onmyoryo of the Ministry of Central Affairs under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the role of a technician (skill official) who conducts divination and geomancy based on the ideology of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, and later oversees divination, sorcery, and various rituals beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer primarily to non-official individuals who privately practice divination, sorcery, and rituals in various places. In modern times, it is defined as a type of clergy who perform private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It may also be pronounced as ""onyoji"" without linking sounds."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements in ancient China, starting from the Xia and Shang dynasties and almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. This Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, as well as closely related disciplines such as astronomy, calendrics, divination, and horology, were introduced to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) directly or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) by the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by the year 512 when scholars from Baekje arrived in Japan during the reign of Emperor Keitai, or by the year 554 when a diviner from China arrived in Japan during the reign of Emperor Kinmei."
"Although the initial influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje to Japan marked the beginning of the influence of onmyodo in Japan. Kanroku, considered a pioneer of onmyodo in Japan, began teaching various studies to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, leading to a significant impact on the country's politics."
"In Japan for the first time, the Rokuyo calendar was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, an envoy was sent to the advanced civilization of Sui in 607 (Emperor Suiko's 15th year). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"After that, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the missions to Sui Dynasty (later Tang Dynasty) as well as inviting numerous monks and scholars from the Korean Peninsula's west coast or mainland China to further absorb knowledge."
"With the introduction of various disciplines, it became important in Japan to consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and to judge auspiciousness and misfortune based on the principles of the five elements generating and overcoming each other. This led to the emphasis on Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy as a strategy to determine auspiciousness and make decisions for various matters."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was skilled in astrology and the Five Elements theory, took a divining rod during the Jinshin War and established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first observatory in 676 (4th year of Tenmu's reign)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin Yang Five Elements philosophy became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasa-sho was officially recognized. This bureau included positions for astronomers, Onmyoji, calendar experts, meteorologists, and timekeepers, who were responsible for conducting public divination alongside the Kiboku officials of the Jingikan."
"Those in charge of introducing continental technology, each doctor and onmyoji are appointed with scholars proficient in Chinese literature and capable of reading Han texts, generally from the mainland powers of Former Han, Later Han, Sui, Goguryeo, Baekje, and occasionally Silla, which initially had influence on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 (2nd year of Tenji), where Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula as Baekje fell, leading to a large number of scholars from Baekje seeking refuge in Silla. Many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo, when it was established, consisted purely of divination, feng shui (similar to what is now called ""geomancy""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the management of the calendar. Therefore, their responsibilities were mainly based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of yin and yang, such as predicting astronomical phenomena, managing the calendar, and determining the auspiciousness of events. They did not perform any religious rituals or sorcery like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played an important role in selecting auspicious days for maintenance work at the imperial court, as well as predicting the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as moving the capital."
The structure of the Onmyo-ryo as a system of government officials and the duties of the Onmyoji.
"In the Onmyo Agency, there is an official called an administrative officer,"
"Supervise the Onmyo Bureau, overseeing all aspects of astronomy, calendars, weather, and atmospheric conditions, recording and sealing any anomalies without leaking to the outside, and reporting them in secret (astronomical secret report). Also responsible for submitting the new year's calendar created by the calendar master by November 1 each year (calendar report), as well as reporting the results of divination and the state of the land as needed."

"As an engineer,"
"An instructor who observes the astronomical phenomena and seals it to prevent leakage to outsiders in case of any anomalies, while also instructing 10 apprentices who are students of astronomy."
"Among the various paths of Yin and Yang, astronomy was considered the most difficult, so it is set at a higher rank than other doctors."
An instructor who leads a group of 10 Yin and Yang students.
It is set at a high rank similar to that of an astronomer.
