"A Christian Protestant school corporation, descended from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, it differs from the so-called mission-oriented universities in that it does not make Christian evangelism its primary purpose (it does not treat education as a means of evangelism)."

"See the entry for ""Ikkyū Dō"" for information on ""Ikkyū-san's Anecdotes,"" while the entry for ""Ikkyū-san"" provides details on the television anime ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, said to be a child of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"The secret tradition says, Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and used the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kashu, and Menggui."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"He entered the Ankoku-ji temple's image collection at the age of six, received precepts, and was given the name Zhou Jian."
"He was gifted with poetic talent from a young age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass"" written at 13 and ""Spring Clothes Dwelling in Flowers"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Sōi and took the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it can't be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyū attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of Kaso Sodan, a high priest at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto, in the year 1415 (the 22nd year of the Oei era)."
"Iku received the monastic name Ikkyū from his master, Haku-sō, after he answered the koan ""Dōzan's Three Meals of Rice"" with the words, ""From the world of forms, return to the world of formlessness. Take a break. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Avaroji (Avarōji)"" refers to the world of delusion (bonnō), while ""Muroji (Murōji)"" refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in 1420, hearing the caw of a crow, he suddenly attained enlightenment."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"Afterward, he lived a life of poetry, satirical poems, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shōkō died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono, from the Fushimi-no-miya family, was welcomed and ascended the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation led to the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hachijo.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Sōjun, the Most Celebrated Monk of the East Sea."""
"However, Sukuo Imai argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was a result of the shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyu's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by the imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. Though he did not reside in the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), due to the Emperor's move to the Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) in Tokyo following the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the capital, was the Inner Palace, but due to war and devastation, it was moved to the Satouchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace, one of the Sato Inner Palaces, served as the residence of the Emperors of the Jimyoin line, who would later be known as the Northern Court."
"The imperial palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located within the Nijō Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the original Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires an application, but it is open to the public in spring and fall."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive Emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace today (21st century) is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is owned by the Japanese government."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across Imoutake-dori to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both Imoutake campuses)."
"The Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Dairi, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the surrounding Kyoto Gyoen National Garden."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"It is noted that, unlike overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. There is an argument that this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity between commoners and rulers (such as the Emperor and other members of the Imperial family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that there has never been an incident in Japan similar to the storming of the Palace of Versailles by the common people during the French Revolution, where it was the residence of the ruling monarch (king), is one of the reasons for this consideration."
"The Imperial Palace in the early days of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the northeast corner of the Senbon-Marutamachi intersection, close to the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the detached palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin Palace. It was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six of which were due to fires), and the existing building was reconstructed in 1855, during the Ansei era, in the Heian style, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved the Imperial Palace to Tokyo a decade earlier, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He commanded that the palace be preserved and its former appearance maintained."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunego-ten, Kosyun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that both the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai would be held in Kyoto.  Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, on the occasion of the enthronement of the current Emperor, the enthronement ceremony was held for the first time at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne symbolizing the Emperor's accession and where he sits during the enthronement ceremony, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the throne was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-post gate with a simple wooden structure, a gable roof, and a cypress bark roof, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality."
"Entering this gate and passing through the vermilion-tiled Jo-mei Gate, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
"This will focus on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property), primarily as it is passed down in the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" the counterpart of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency in Japan, the term refers to all music performed by the department, excluding Western music."
Much of it is inherited as court music in instrumental works.
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world that is still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, the traditional ensemble form of Gagaku was lost for over a century after the Ōnin War, until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form is still preserved."
"It is inferred that the katakana notation of the hichiriki score, when sung as a shoga (singing with a melody while reading the score aloud), faithfully reproduces the pronunciation of the Japanese language prior to the 16th century, including the use of fa, fi, fu, fe, and fo for the ""h"" sound, and other aspects of the language."
"The notation used in the Raku Biwa, written in Chinese characters, shares many similarities with the Biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and it appears to inherit many ancient styles transmitted from the continent."
"The most important historical material is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) who lamented the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shō gakka family compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, which is a valuable document about ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music transmitted from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, said to have been transmitted from China, which is currently played in Japanese Gagaku, is said to be based on the music played at banquets called Yanle during the Tang dynasty."
"The categories of music, such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lâm Ấp music (Champa music), reveal an international character, and elements of ancient Japanese music predating the introduction of continental music are also included."
"Before the modern era, the Tennoji Gakuso (Osaka) of Shitennoji Temple, which preserved the oldest style, the Dai-naikaku Gakuso (Kyoto) of the Imperial Palace, and the Nanto Gakuso (Nara) of Kasuga Taisha Shrine, were considered the Three Great Gakuso."
"These musical institutions, later called ""Tokyo"" in modern times, became the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music club, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces of music are being passed down in the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics reference the S-country style of singing and dancing.
Things transmitted from outside of Japan (some consider this to be the only form of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... China, India, Lin-yi (South Vietnam)"
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origins."
These include songs produced in Japan (Honkyoku) that imitate the aforementioned style.
Songs created during the Heian period (utaimono).
The lyrics refer to a song.
"Sometimes, Kokufu Kabuki and Yōkyoku are collectively referred to as Ancient Japanese Songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shinryu was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shinryo, was from the low-ranking naturalized clan, the Washi, so he was not expected to become Crown Prince. Initially, he aimed for a career as a bureaucrat, holding positions such as Chamberlain, Minister of Education, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were suddenly deposed, and he was made Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, Heijō-kyō was built in 784, but it was later replaced by Heian-kyō in 794."
They also sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of the Conquest to invade Tohoku and subjugate the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugutomo of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship that such military activities and construction projects imposed on the peasantry."
"He is said to have conceived the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of cultural aspects."
It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from China and brought new impetus to Buddhism in Japan.
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Tado, and was further tarnished by the exile and subsequent death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the emperor's younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince, under the suspicion of being assassinated by Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's grave was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the rank of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too powerful through their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"Furthermore, the palace was said to be in a state of disarray, which laid the groundwork for the later ""Yakushi's Rebellion."""
"Died on March 17, 806 (Year 25 of the Enryaku era)."
"He was posthumously bestowed the Japanese-style posthumous name, Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsujiya-derino-mikoto."
"He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title, ""Emperor Kanmu."""
He was also called Kashiwabara-tei and Tenkoku Ossebari Mikami Kashiwabara-tenno.
"The mausoleum is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"Though he had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi due to divination."
"With the Meiji Restoration, the first emperor of Heian-kyō was enshrined at Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, prior to the Emperor's birthday, Emperor Akihito, in a customary press conference, made a statement about the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup in the following year. Part of the statement said, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and discussed in South Korean media."
"Some reports made significant leaps in logic, claiming that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and promoting the theory of Baekje origins of the Imperial Family."
"The Otani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hiromitsu was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushinni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of head priest (Hoshū) of Honganji, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the Jodo Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The origin of the surname Ōtani is attributed to the location of Shinran's mausoleum, which was established at Ōtani, north gate of Chion-in temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"While Hongan-ji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), was a force comparable to warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement, it is sometimes counted as one of the Sengoku daimyo.  The temple head's dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Hongan-ji,"" such as ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" and ""Hongan-ji Kosuke."" However, this is merely a convenient designation. The Hongan-ji temple head's lineage never adopted ""Hongan-ji"" as their family name, and the ""Hongan-ji"" clan never existed."
"Jaku Shinni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ohtani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, a temple dedicated to Shinran, became the grand Ootani Mausoleum, revered by followers of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism.  Kakukei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, was appointed to manage the temple in her absence."
"However, the Ootani Temple, due to its gathering of pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later became embroiled in a dispute over the absentee post between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and  Yuisen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee post by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Jōko transformed the temple into a monastery, giving birth to the Ōtani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo,  developed its religious organization.  During the Muromachi period, the fifth head priest, Shaknyo, expanded the temple's influence into the Hokuriku region.  By the time of the seventh head priest, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been actively building their organizations since Shinran's death, the formation of the Honganji temple was significantly delayed. During the early Muromachi period, it was considered a sub-temple of the Shoren-in temple, and the Ootani family is said to have served as a steward for the Konoe family due to their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's family)."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and subsequently to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki (peasant uprising) occurred in 1488, driving out the Togashi clan, the guardian of Kaga, and leading to a situation known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For about a hundred years, until 1580, it was almost a country ruled by the Ikkō-shū sect."
"As the 16th century dawned amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, wielding its organizational power that spanned from small farmers to the samurai classes of jizamurai and tozama, saw its activities flourish across Japan. However, the Yamaoka Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke War. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), which had been founded by Rennyo, and established it as Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located at the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Terrace.
"It controlled Osaka, a vital hub for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji Temple,  Shoko established close ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, securing a stable foundation for the Honganji's power."
"On the other hand, towards the end of Shonyo's era, some within the Honganji sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to pursue independent paths, breaking free from the control of the Honganji temple."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Honganji Buddhist sect, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and attempting to seize lordship from religious forces to establish unified rule."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji gain the upper hand. This was due to the combined efforts of Kannon and his followers, who fortified the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the temple's devotees, who resisted Oda forces across the land. This protracted struggle proved a significant challenge for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, among other local resistances being suppressed. In 1578, the Mori clan, allied with the Honganji Temple, suffered a naval defeat at the Battle of Kizu River against the Oda navy, marking a string of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own territory."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple continued to maintain its strength by gathering support from groups like the Saika-shu, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, finally succumbing to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, Hongan-ji Temple evacuated Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.  With this, Hongan-ji Temple's power as a territorial lord ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyo-nyo, the eldest son, argued for continuing the resistance against the wishes of Ken-nyo, leading to a rift between them.  When Ken-nyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Jun-nyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point onwards, the Honganji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the East Honganji Temple, distinct from Kyo'nyo's Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers left Junyo's sect, which had become Nishi Honganji, and went to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to a split in the Honganji temple."
"Both the Eastern and Western Ootani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a long-standing tradition of adopting sons from powerful court nobles. They have also consistently intermarried with court nobles, furthering their assimilation into the court nobility through their maternal lineage."
"Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture, and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"Kyotaba City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It sits at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"It is bordered by the Kizu River, which flows north-south along the eastern side of the city, and the Ikoma Mountains to the west, with the West Japan Railway Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line running through the center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are strongly characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture after八幡市, the first in 20 years, and the 669th in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment), with the city name change to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" being implemented on the same day, using ""Kyo"" from Kyoto Prefecture."
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is flourishing, with Gyokuro as a specialty product."

The statue of Zen Master Ikkyu and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe city, while Matsuiyamaguchi Station functions as the central station for the Keihan Higashi Rose Town area."
Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is also served by ordinary trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line.
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city's name around the time of its municipal incorporation.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"Kii-Tanabe Station (Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture. The use of ""Kii,"" the old province name of Wakayama, in the station name appears to be to avoid duplication with other stations in the same West Japan Railway Company (JR West) region."

Musashi Province was one of the provinces of Japan under the Ritsuryo system.
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama and Tokyo east of the Sumida River, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama)."
"Rank in Engishiki, kokushi koku-toku kubu, enkoku."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 AD (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyo, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanned the districts of Katsura and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city, 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city from the palace, dividing the city into the Left Capital (East) and the Right Capital (West)."
"The floor plan is essentially based on Heijokyo, following the model of Chang'an in the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony,"" which originated from Feng Shui."
The extent of Heian-kyō was smaller than present-day Kyoto City.
"The northernmost main road, Ichijo-dori, is located between the present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is present-day Kujo Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
"The Tokyo Gokudai-ro, the eastern limit, corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori."
The estimated location of the Saikyo-ku Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR West San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Railway Kyoto Line Saikyo-ku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""machi"" (blocks) of 40 jo (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west, excluding the two rows on the northern edge, is called a ""条 (jou)"".  A group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊 (bou)""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each assigned a number.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jūyonchō."""
"The width of roads, even small lanes, was 4 zhang (about 12 meters), while major roads were 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters).
"Also, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-Horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi-Horikawa River) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been intended to establish a new capital for the Tenji Emperor's lineage, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the nobility and temples that supported the Tenmu Emperor's lineage was concentrated."
"However, only ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyo."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent deposition of Prince Shiraka, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyo's construction."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), so it did not become urbanized until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely a shell, the capital was so desolate that it was even used for agricultural purposes, something that was strictly forbidden within the city walls."
"Noble residences were established in the Left Capital, except for the northern part of the Right Capital, which was located near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical record compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records the 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
"Edited by Fujiwara Tsuguo, et al."
"According to the preface, in the year 819, Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryosen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three other participants died before the task was completed, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuyo, Naoe-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minemori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further imperial edict was issued, ordering Fujiwara Tsugushi, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori to carry out the task."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and藤原緒嗣 alone was involved in the project throughout the three generations of emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan"", it records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, beginning from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes until the early 15th century, it subsequently scattered.  It was Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of  Hanawa Hokiichi, who first published it based on a 10-volume copy discovered in the Sanjo-nishi family (though there is also a different theory that it was based on a revised edition by Yanagihara Kikō)."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kanmu), 14 and 17 (Heijo), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes.  The reign of Emperor Junna is entirely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of a work to a certain extent by referencing excerpts from the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories,"" and the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" a categorized compilation of the ""Six National Histories."""
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes from various sources, there are ""Nihon Iti-shi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itibun"", which have been subsequently published by Shueisha with annotations and by Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
This content is said to most reflect the opinion of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The inclusion of short biographies (kōden) in death notices for emperors and court officials followed the precedent of the ""Shoku Nihongi"" and was consistent with subsequent historical texts."
"However, the biography in this book avoids falling into one-sided, official praise or criticism, and instead features numerous intriguing descriptions that incorporate unique critiques and reflections, making it an anomaly among the Six National Histories for its sustained critical spirit."
"It is also known that, compared to the historical texts before and after it, the Rikkokushi included a large number of waka poems."
Sei Shōnagon (c. 966 – c. 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" circle."
"There is an old legend that identifies the mother of [the subject] as the ""Higa no Ona"" who appears in the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"Among their siblings are:  the head of Gagaku, Tameyoshi;  the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice, Chishin;  the Tendai monk at the Flower Mountain Palace, Kai-shu; and a woman who married the brother of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (the brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name is a court title, with ""Sei"" derived from the surname Kiyohara and ""Shonagon"" from the title of a relative."
"The real name is unknown, though some sources, such as the ""Makura no Soshi"" (""The Pillow Book""), suggest it may have been ""Nagiko,"" but this is not reliable."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of poems, ""The Poems of Sei Shonagon,"" containing 42 poems (the number varies depending on the manuscript; the most widely circulated version has 31 poems), survives."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reigned: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe Takamichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He was originally a Buddhist monk, but after Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other vassals."
He was then supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province to ascend to Kyoto and become the 15th Shogun.
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle him."
"Though they briefly cornered Nobunaga, they were eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending the Muromachi shogunate."
He later spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537 (Tenbun 6), as the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his older brother, Yoshiaki, was heir apparent, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijo-in temple of Kofuku-ji) as a foster child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, and took the name Kakkei."
He later rose to the position of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Yoshikatsu, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and confined to the Kofukuji temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared making the Kofukuji temple their enemy by killing Jōkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and was promised the position of head priest of the Kofukuji temple in the future, so they confined him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiaki."
"Books that record Yoshiaki's story refer to him by the alternate name ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was said to have been attacked by night robbers when he was exiled from Kyoto and was also called the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Jushi-ge, and appointed as Sama no kami."
"However, while there are doubts regarding the exact date of his appointment, the ""Kanetsugu Kyoki"" by Sanjō Kanetsugu states that in February of 1568, the day of the declaration of the shogunate for Ashikaga Yoshihide, who was Yoshiaki's rival, Kanetsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's messenger arrived at his residence requesting mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to the rank of Jushiinoge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed prior to this event."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku father and son, Yoshikata and Yoshiharu, in Omi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshitaka in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal strife over the headship and power struggles among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, and had no intention of actively marching to Kyoto with the newly-returned-to-the-lay-world Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the march to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of capping was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (Note, there are absolutely no historical records of Yoshiaki having formally come of age at this point, which means his coming of age was incredibly late for the time.)"
"He later moved to Mino Province with the help of Akechi Mitsuhide, a high-ranking official of the Asakura clan, to seek the patronage of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and appointed as Counselor and Middle General of the Left Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway for almost its entire length. There is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, and both connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is used."
"The line color is blue (■) and, along with the JR Kobe Line, it is positioned as the company's main line, so the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service runs parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, connecting Kyoto and Osaka (42.8 km) in a minimum of 28 minutes (maximum speed: 130 km/h)."
All sections are quad-track with separate quad-track lines (outer and inner).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
A unified operation management system is in place across the entire Sanyo Line.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"The line offers local, rapid, and express trains directly connecting to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as limited express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR restructuring, the number of express trains on this section dramatically increased, with the introduction of overnight limited express trains to Kyushu starting and ending in Shin-Osaka, limited express trains to the Nanki region starting in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" service to the San'in region, launched after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all extending their routes to Kyoto."
"The Haruka train, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains become regular services to Kyoto within a year of its launch. The New Osaka - Kyoto route has become a corridor of express trains, with about four trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Raicho"" and other services."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, with the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" entering the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka Station enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and then enter Shin-Osaka Station via the Suita signal box."
"Therefore, the travel time is slightly longer than express or rapid trains running on the outer track in the same section, and sometimes two express trains arrive at Shin-Osaka at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is almost entirely straight, and the outer tracks can handle speeds of 130 km/h except for a few curved sections."
"The inner track is also compatible with 120 km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for empty trains or temporary trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also empty trains, such as the ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki,"" which run on this section for entering and leaving the Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Furthermore, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains' deadhead runs between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka station, passes through Tsukamoto station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used when the train is departing.)"
"Therefore, the train's formation is reversed when it's running for loading and unloading."
"The New Rapid service runs direct from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, and the Sanyo Main Line's Amagasaki, Kamigori, and Ako Line's Banshu-Ako stations, through the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, and to Omi-Shiotsu and Tsuruga on the Hokuriku Main Line."
"From midday to evening, there will be a train every 15 minutes, with one daytime train heading towards the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four trains run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12-car trains using JR West Series 223-1000 and Series 223-2000 trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a 100km-long expressway (National Route 478)."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, this road strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, revitalizes the region, and serves as a southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-grade road network."
"The Kyoto Governor refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections, the starting point, the central section, and the ending point, are open. The starting point opened as the Kei-Shi Bypass, not the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers only to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is scheduled to be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies, making the passage of small vehicles impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between Ayabe Kita-Honsen Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer or autumn of 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the corporation, resulting in the current free section of Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita-Honson Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji Toll Plaza will be newly established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. This eliminates all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Road.
The current Ayabe Kita-Honsen Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the post-opening management structure remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: National Route 9, Oinonosaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a toll road, while National Route 9, Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Katuragi IC to Chiyogawa IC, formerly part of National Route 9, is redesignated as National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC - Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Ooe IC (temporary two-lane, opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations involved in road-related affairs were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Agency Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a ■ background color in the IC number column indicate sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of the other line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei, at an elevation of 848 meters, as its grounds."
"Though known as Enryaku-ji Temple, it is often referred to as Mount Hiei or, more commonly, Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The Chief Priest (or Head Priest) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism, alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"It embraced the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land practices, thus resembling a comprehensive university of Buddhism. During the Heian period, it gained the respect of the Imperial family and the aristocracy, becoming a powerful force."
"Especially, esoteric practices and prayers gained support from the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric teachings of Toji Temple (Shingon sect) were called ""To-mitsu,"" while those of Enryakuji Temple were known as ""Dai-mitsu,"" competing for supremacy."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective name for the numerous temples and pagodas scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and the Sixteen Valleys."
"Its origin dates back to 788, when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Jikan-in."
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which took its name from the year of its founding, was only granted in 824, the 14th year of the弘仁 era, after the death of Saicho."
"Enryakuji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks and is credited with laying the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism.  Many prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history, including Ennin, Enchin, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen Buddhism, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen Buddhism, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, all underwent rigorous training on Mount Hiei in their youth.  For this reason, Enryakuji is often called the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei has appeared in numerous literary works.
"Furthermore, rigorous training like the ""Twelve Years of Mountain Retreat"" and the ""Thousand Days of Peak Pilgrimage"" continues to this day, making it a leading sacred site in Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, a mountain whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a site of mountain worship since ancient times.  The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the mountain's eastern slopes, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuo-no-Obi Hiro-no, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (some sources say 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the year 780, he received the tonsure (became a monk) under the monk Gyōhyō at the Omi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 (the 4th year of the Enryaku era), he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, driven by his own aspirations, chose not to pursue a secure position at a grand temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, devoting himself to training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the current location of the Main Hall, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which takes its name from an era, was granted after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the弘仁 era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the Emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national protectorate, guarding the northeast, Kyoto's ""demon gate."""
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a gengakushou (short-term overseas trainee)."
"He sailed to Tang in 804, on a ship dispatched from Japan."
"Saicho went to the sacred Mount Hiei, where he studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dosui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyoman."
"Moreover, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from Shunkyo Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing)."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, alternative interpretations exist (see below)."
The name is also read as Tsukiyomi.
"Although the Kojiki contains a story of the slaying of the food deity, Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the chronicles themselves do not provide any descriptions to determine its gender."
"In many foreign mythologies, the moon deity is often a goddess, and there are also many aggressive goddesses in other cultures. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male deity, and thus support the theory that the deity was female."
"Tsukiyomi, considered the god of the moon, has varying accounts of his divinity across different texts."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing from the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the *Nihon Shoki*  contrasts with the *Kojiki*, stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The text also offers inconsistent accounts of her dominion, including the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, has a similar concept found in various myths, as pointed out in the field of comparative mythology."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is an origin myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon after his death. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and it was only later that they were identified as the same deity."
"Furthermore, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, it is narrated that on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and the moon, and appointed them to rule over day and night, dividing light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the worldwide sun-moon origin myth, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi has a limited presence in the ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihon Shoki"" narratives, with a generally unspectacular role."
"Only briefly, in the fifth section, the eleventh book of the ""Nihon Shoki,"" is the origin of grains mentioned."
There is also a theory that this balances the opposing characters of Amaterasu and Susanoo by placing a god who does nothing between them.
"Similar structures are also found in the relationships of Amenominakanushi to Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri to Hoori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some believe that Susanoo and [another deity] are the same god, as their domains and episodes overlap in part."
"Born from the washing of Izanagi's right eye in the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity is known as one of the ""Three Noble Children,"" alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi no Mikoto is commanded to ""inform the land of night's food,"" but he has no further exploits after this."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in Yomi no Kuni.
"While the fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo-ki simply states that the moon god, radiating a brilliance second only to the sun, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun, a different account in the First Book of the same text describes Izanagi holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand when he gave birth to Ōhirume-no-mikoto and a white bronze mirror in his right hand when he gave birth to Tsukiyumi-no-mikoto."
"While some stories tell of Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside another deity, other narratives suggest that she was tasked with ruling ""the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" likely stemming from the concept of the moon's control over tides. This parallel existence of multiple narratives surrounding the birth of the three deities highlights their multifaceted nature."
"In the eleventh chapter of the fifth volume of the Chronicles, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi, the Food Goddess, in the heavens, and he descended to her abode."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as a gesture of hospitality, vomited rice from her mouth, which angered the Moon God Tsukiyomi, who then killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the Grain Deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, giving rise to grains."
"Onmyōji, a title for officials who belonged to the Yin-Yang Bureau of the Ministry of Central Affairs during the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system."
"The official position assigned to practitioners of Yin-Yang divination and geomancy, based on the philosophy of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, later expanded beyond its original legal mandate to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, magic, and ritual ceremonies in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'yōji"" without the sound of ""n"" connecting."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which posits that all phenomena are constituted by combinations of these principles, originated in the ancient Chinese Xia and Shang dynasties and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty. This philosophy, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendar, divination, and timekeeping, was directly transmitted from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or through the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) between the 5th and 6th centuries, reaching Japan during the Asuka period, no later than 512 AD (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) with the arrival of the Five Classics scholars from Baekje, or 554 AD (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) with the arrival of divination experts."
"Although their initial impact on politics and culture was minimal, these studies began to exert a significant influence on the nation's governance in 602 AD (the 10th year of Empress Suiko's reign) when Kanroku, considered the pioneer of Yin-Yang philosophy in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar. In 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), envoys were sent to Sui, a leading civilization, to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods. The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy was also strongly reflected in the Seventeen-Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve-rank cap system."
"Thereafter, the court continued to send students with envoys to Sui (and later Tang) dynasties, and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, where envoys stopped, in order to acquire more knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became crucial to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to judge good fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the five elements (五行) theory of mutual generation and overcoming, thereby predicting the future and obtaining guidance for all matters of human affairs.""  Consequently, the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of determining good fortune and misfortune, and establishing behavioral guidelines."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, renowned for his mastery of divination and the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, even using divination tools during the Jinshin War, established the ""Yin-Yang Office"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the fourth year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 AD (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the increasing popularity of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought.  In 718 AD, the Yōrō Code formalized the establishment of the Onmyōryō as a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, appointing astronomers, yin-yang masters, calendar experts, and timekeeping specialists as permanent officials.  This officially recognized the Onmyōryō as a body responsible for divination, alongside the Shinto shrine's practice of tortoise shell divination."
"Only those skilled in techniques transmitted from the mainland were assigned to each doctor and Onmyoji, and they were typically immigrants who were well-versed in various fields and adept at reading Classical Chinese, including those who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui (which later dominated the mainland), Goguryeo and Baekje (which held sway over the western coast of the Korean peninsula), and occasionally Silla (which was initially a power in the eastern Korean peninsula)."
"In particular, following the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed.  Prior to and after this event, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje arrived in Japan as refugees, many of whom were appointed to official positions."
"The early practices of the Yin Yang Bureau were purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the management of clepsydras. It exclusively relied on theoretical analysis based on Yin Yang and Five Elements principles to predict astronomical phenomena, manage time, and foretell auspicious or inauspicious events. It did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like those practiced by the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, it played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial Court, and in determining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and direction, proving particularly important during relocations of the capital."
