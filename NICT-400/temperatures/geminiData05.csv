The Doshisha Educational Corporation is a school corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha is a comprehensive educational institution founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, a Christian Protestant (Congregationalist), and based on Christian principles. It comprises nine educational institutions, from university to kindergarten, all bearing the name ""Doshisha"" (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 people were studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University, a school corporation, holds an <AA+> rating from Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest of 21 ratings.
"It is among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha University is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Josiah Conder envisioned the cultivation of individuals who could ""apply their conscience to their skills"" as the purpose of his educational institution."
"We aspired to cultivate individuals ""filled with the fullness of conscience"" by fostering ""moral education"" based on Christianity alongside intellectual education, ensuring a balanced development."
"Monuments bearing his thoughts, inscribed in his own handwriting, stand at Doshisha University and other institutions."
"This monument of conscience bears the inscription, ""May men arise whose whole being is filled with conscience."""
"Furthermore, to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" are proclaimed, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation"" through these principles."
"A Christian Protestant school corporation, stemming from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, unlike so-called mission-oriented universities, it does not make Christian evangelism its primary purpose (it does not use education as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded Doshisha English School in Kyoto's Teramachi-dori Marutamachi."
Moved from Teramachi to Imadegawa in 1876.
Doshisha Branch School for Women was established in April 1877 and renamed Doshisha Girls' School in September.
Doshisha established its regulations in 1883.
"In 1888, the intention to establish Doshisha University was announced in major newspapers and magazines nationwide."
"In 1896, the ordinary school was renamed Doshisha Higher Ordinary School."
Established Doshisha Elementary School.

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism during the Muromachi period.
Known as a model of storytelling.
"For ""Ikkyū-san's Anecdotes of Wit,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-dō"" (this page also has a brief description). For the television anime ""Ikkyū-san,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
The secret tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu.
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kaltro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Soushun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(For information on posthumous Buddhist names and Dharma names, please refer to the ""Posthumous Buddhist Name"" section.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Ankokuji Temple in Kyoto and was ordained, receiving the name Zhou Jian."
"His poetic talent shone early, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass,"" written at age 13, and ""Spring Clothes Dwell in Flowers,"" written at age 15, gained acclaim and praise throughout Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and took the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodan, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Oei era)."
"Ikyu received the Dharma name ""Ikyu"" from Hasso after answering the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Rice"" with the words, ""From the world of existence to the world of non-existence, I return.  Rest for a while.  If it rains, let it rain.  If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (klesha), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."
"One night in 1420, the sound of a crow's cry led to a sudden enlightenment."
"Hasso intended to grant Ikkyu a certificate of authorization, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verses, calligraphy, and painting, marked by eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation played a role in Emperor Go-Hachijo's ascension to the throne.
"From the ""Chronological Biography of Ikkyu Zenji of Tokai."""
"However, Shukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was approved by the shogunate, and Ikkū's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by the Imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado. Although he did not reside at the temple, he dedicated himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Imperial Palace in Tokyo (former Edo Castle) was preserved in 1877, following the Emperor's move to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but it fell into disrepair due to wars and other disturbances, leading to the relocation of the Imperial Court to the Satō Inner Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Satō Inner Palaces, and it served as the residence of the Emperors of the Jimyōin line, later known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it's open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present day (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sennyo-in Palace, and separated by Imadegawa-dori to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"The Imperial Household Agency currently manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace, unlike those of overseas castles, are not particularly high, there is a theory that this reflects the difference in the level of familiarity that commoners felt towards their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and the West."
"For example, the fact that there has never been an event in Japan similar to the storming of the Palace of Versailles by commoners during the French Revolution, which was the residence of the ruling monarch (king), is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located significantly further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the intersection of Senbon and Marutamachi, northeast of the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six of which were due to fires), and the existing structure, known as the Ansei Palace, was rebuilt in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo just ten years prior, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered its preservation and maintenance to its former glory."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their Enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the enthronement ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, the ceremony was held for the first time at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor symbolizing his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a simple wooden structure, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special events, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two flanking earthen walls each have five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality for a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Music Department of the Imperial Household Agency, the term ""court music"" refers to all music performed by the department, excluding Western music."
"Much of it is inherited as court music, mainly instrumental."
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world still performed in large ensembles.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form, Gagaku was discontinued for over a century after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate brought together descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable to what extent it retains the form of the Heian period."
"It is speculated that the vocalization of the hiragana notation for the hichiriki, including the pronunciation of the ""h"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo"" as was common in Japanese before the 16th century, is a fairly faithful reproduction of the original, especially considering the overall approach."
"The notation used in the 楽琵琶, written in kanji characters, shares many similarities with the pipa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and further reflects a strong inheritance of ancient continental styles."
"The most important historical document is the *Tai Gensho*, written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) who lamented the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) during the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū, of the Shōgakusha family, compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, focusing on the shō, which is a valuable document on gagaku of the ancient era."
"It is derived from ritual music that originated in China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, considered to have originated in China and now performed in Japanese Gagaku, is said to be based on the music of Yanle, which was played at banquets during the Tang Dynasty."
"The categories of music, such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lâm Ấp music (Cham music), suggest a rich international character, and the music also contains elements of ancient Japanese music predating the arrival of music from the continent."
"Prior to the modern era, the three major musical institutions were the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara), representing the three directions of the country."
"These musical institutions, called to Tokyo in the modern era, would form the basis of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department, but the traditions of each institution continue in their respective regions."
"It also shows mutual influences from folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin Yi (South Vietnam) influences."
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China)"
These include songs (honkyoku) produced in Japan imitating the style mentioned above.
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period.
The lyrics refer to the song.
"Sometimes, Kokufu Kabuki and Yōkyoku are collectively referred to as ancient Japanese songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing their lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of humble origin, a naturalized clan from the Wa clan. Thus, he was not expected to become Crown Prince and initially sought advancement as an official, serving as a Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, he was suddenly made Crown Prince on January 2, 773, after his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoe, were deposed in a political struggle that involved the Fujiwara clan."
"He moved the capital to Yamashiro Province, fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo."
"Initially, Heijo-kyo was constructed in 784, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built anew."
"They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, the Great General of the Conquest, to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship his military and construction projects inflicted upon the peasantry."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of cultural significance."
"It was under the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marked by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, and the exile and death of Prince Sawara, the emperor's younger brother who had been designated as Crown Prince, in 785 on charges of involvement in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the position of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too powerful due to their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial palace was a breeding ground for the later ""Yakushi no Hen"" incident."
"Died on March 17, 806."
"He was given the Japanese posthumous title ""Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi Ya-deri-no-Mikoto."""
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku-oshiharai-Miyu Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The mausoleum is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"Though he had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi due to divination."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three shrines within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference preceding his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments regarding the upcoming joint hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and discussed in the Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making large leaps in logic."
"The Otani family is a house name descended from Kakkei, the son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of the head priest (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji temple, the dominant sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"Both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Honbyo), which split from the former in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji era."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum in the Otani area, north of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Eastern Hills."
"While the Honganji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), wielded power comparable to that of warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-ikki movement, and is sometimes counted among the Sengoku Daimyo, its head priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honganji,"" as in ""Honganji Kannon"" or ""Honganji Kosa,"" this is merely a convenient designation. The Honganji Temple head priest lineage never adopted ""Honganji"" as their family name or surname, nor did a ""Honganji"" clan ever exist."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to enshrine his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, the temple of Ootani, became the mausoleum of Shinran, revered by Jodo Shinshu followers, and was entrusted to Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani Temple, attracting pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the position of absentee abbot between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Yuizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee abbot position by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the temple into a monastery, marking the birth of the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, developed its religious organization. During the Muromachi period, under the fifth abbot, Shakanyo, it expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the seventh abbot, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working on forming their own sects since Shinran's death, the formation of the Honganji sect lagged behind significantly. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in, and the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the late 15th century, the Jodo Shinshu sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of the 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Hongan-ji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province and later to Yamashina, on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, resulting in the expulsion of the Togashi clan, the guardian of Kaga, by the Honganji Buddhist sect. This led to a situation where Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amid the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Hongan-ji sect, wielding its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamaoka Hongan-ji was destroyed in a fire during the Tenbun Hokke Rebellion in 1532. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Go-bo, established by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), which became known as Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic point for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo strengthened the temple's power base by forging close ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōko era, some members of the Honganji Buddhist sect in regions such as Hokuriku began to pursue their own independent paths, breaking away from the control of the Honganji temple."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji temple, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to unify the Kinai region by seizing control from religious forces and establishing his own dominion."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand due to the combined efforts of Kannon and his followers, who were entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and the temple's followers who resisted the Oda clan throughout the land. This ultimately caused significant hardship for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, suppressing resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats outside the Honganji Temple."
"Despite maintaining its strength by gathering support from groups like the Saika, Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had secured an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to abandon Ishiyama Hongan-ji. With this, Hongan-ji's power as a feudal lord was extinguished."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, who advocated continuing resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, clashed with him. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point onward, the Honganji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the East Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyonyo."
"At this time, many followers left Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, and went to Kyo-nyo's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to a split in the Honganji temple."
"Both the Eastern and Western Ootani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (Jakujo's father), have a long-standing tradition of adopting sons from powerful court families. They also continued to intermarry with court nobles through the generations, resulting in a gradual increase in their own courtly status through their maternal lineage."
"Kyoutanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture, Osaka Prefecture, and Nara Prefecture in southern Kyoto Prefecture."
"Kyoutanabe City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, situated in the central part of the triangular area of the three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River running north-south on the east side of the city and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line through its center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are strongly characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment), with the city name being changed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" on the same day, using the ""Kyo"" from Kyoto Prefecture."
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
It is renowned for its tea (Uji tea) cultivation and specializes in producing gyokuro.
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city.
"Yamaki-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Delivery area includes neighboring Itecho, Tsuzuki District)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyu and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station of the Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the same time the city was incorporated.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Main Line's Nishi-Mukai Station and Higashi-Mukai Station.
"While there is a ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the inclusion of ""Kii,"" the former province of Wakayama, in the station name located in Tanabe City is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company region."

Musashi Province was one of the former provinces of Japan under the Ritsuryo system.
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama Prefecture, the area east of the Sumida River in Tokyo excluding islands, and the northeastern portion of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki, Provincial Governor Rank Classification, Remote Province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō was a rectangular city built on the border of Kazuragi and Atago counties in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the central part of present-day Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It measured 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"They established the Imperial Palace at the north end of the capital, and from there, they laid out Suzaku Avenue, which ran through the center of the city, with Sakyo (east) and Ukyo (west) on either side."
"The floor plan essentially follows the Heijo-kyo model, emulating the Sui and Tang Chang'an."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony,"" a principle derived from Chinese Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyo area was smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo Street, located between present-day Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
"The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is currently Kujo Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's main road corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the Nishikyogoku-Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishikyogoku Station in a north-south direction.
"The city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (about 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south and east-west."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""条"", and a group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same district were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
The width of roads was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) for small lanes and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for main roads.
Existing roads in Kyoto are much narrower in most places.
It was 28 zhang (about 84 meters) wide at Zhuque Avenue.
"Moreover, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi Horikawa) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishi Horikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to break away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Tenmu Emperor lineage was concentrated, and establish a new capital under the Tenji Emperor lineage."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyo, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sayo, and the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo."
The construction of Heian-kyō likely began with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), so it remained undeveloped until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had become largely a formality, the capital was in such a state of decay that farmland, which was originally forbidden within the city limits, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"The residential areas for the nobility were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical text compiled during the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Otsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the tenth year of the Kōnin era (819), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryōzen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"Three of the original four, excluding Otsugu, died before the task was completed, so Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Naoe-o, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minamori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, entrusting the task to Fujiwara Tsugushi, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation, which spanned 21 years and three reigns, was solely the work of Fujiwara no Otsugu."
"It follows the ""Chronicles of Japan"" and records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"It originally comprised 40 volumes, but was scattered after the early 15th century. It was first published when Inayama Gyokyo, a student of  Hanawa Hokiichi, discovered a 10-volume copy at the Sanjo-nishi family (another theory suggests it was a corrected edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu)."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling ten volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct a certain degree of the text from excerpts of the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" which is an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories,"" and citations from the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" which is a categorized compilation of the ""Six National Histories."""
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes from various sources, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun,"" which have been referenced in the Shueisha Annotated Japanese Historical Materials and the Kodansha Academic Library publications."
It is said that the content most reflects the opinions of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of attaching short biographies (kōden) to death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent of the *Shoku Nihongi*, was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the chronicle of the deceased emperor in this book does not fall into the usual one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather contains many interesting descriptions interlaced with unique criticisms and observations, making it a unique work in the Six National Histories for its persistence of critical spirit."
It is also known that the Rikkokushi included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical texts.
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some say her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother with ""Higaki no Ona"" in the ""Gosenshu Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (or possibly grandfather, according to some sources) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū anthology."
"There are siblings, including the Chief of Music, Tameari, the Assistant Minister of the Left, Tadasada, the priest Kaiju of the Flower Mountain Palace, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara Norinaga (brother of Fujiwara Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shonagon's name, a lady-in-waiting, is said to be derived from her family name, Kiyohara, and the title of a relative, ""Shonagon."""
"The real name is unknown. Some say it was ""Nagiko"" (according to ""Makura no Soshi""), but this is not credible."
"She is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collection of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most common version has 31) has been passed down."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies after the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe Nobutada."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"Having initially been a Buddhist monk, he escaped from Kyoto with the assistance of  Motonari Hosokawa and other retainers after Yoshiaki was assassinated by Nagahisa Matsunaga."
"And, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province, he ascended to Kyoto and became the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to create a siege network against Nobunaga."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively marking its demise."
He then spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537 (Tenbun 6), the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, at a young age, entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji), and took the name Kakkei."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Miyoshi Three, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Chūsō, the abbot of Rokuon-in Temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple (it is said that Hisahide and the others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of abbot of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they confined him instead of killing him)."
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was chased from Kyoto and is said to have been attacked by night thieves, earning him the nickname ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Jushi no ge, and assigned to the position of Sama no kami."
"However, while the date of his appointment is disputed, Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki"" records that on February 1568, the day of the shogunal investiture of Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiie's rival, a messenger from Yoshiaki appeared at Tokitsugu's residence, who was the envoy for the investiture, requesting mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi no ge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had been appointed before this date."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Ōmi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to Wakasa Province in August, seeking asylum with his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitaka."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal strife and power struggles among its senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at ""Kuratani Gosho,"" and had no intention of actively going up to Kyoto with Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who had just returned to secular life, so the ascent to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there is no historical record of Yoshiaki formally coming of age at this point, making his coming of age exceptionally late for the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, backed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18, he was appointed as the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Councilor and Lieutenant General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both of which connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, respectively. Therefore, the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as the company's main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8km along the right bank of the Yodo River, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed: 130km/h)."
It is a four-track line with four tracks in each direction (outer and inner tracks).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) Suica, Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line Operation Management System.
It operates as an integrated service with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line also serves as a route for rapid, semi-rapid, and local trains that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as special express trains to Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, express trains to Kyushu that had originated in Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula that had originated in Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began operation with the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all began making direct runs to Kyoto, significantly increasing the number of express trains on this route."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto within a year.  The New Osaka - Kyoto line has become a corridor of express trains, with the Haruka running alongside other trains such as the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird,"" with around four departures per hour."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, as part of the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" entering the Hanwa Line after passing through the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka, enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and proceed to Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains that run on the outer tracks on the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with the outer tracks capable of 130 km/h operation except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also compatible with 120 km/h, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also empty trains such as ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" running on this section for entering and leaving Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird"", ""Raicho"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains running between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west, and then merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed when it is running in and out of the station."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Line Amagasaki, Kamigori, and Ako Line Banshu-Ako to JR Kyoto Line, then to Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one midday service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running direct to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains will be operated using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, in 8- or 12-car formations."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100 km, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478) starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, it strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, promotes regional revitalization, and serves as a southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the center, and the ending point. The starting point opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass,"" not ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway."
"Furthermore, the section between Kuze-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and travel by small vehicles, etc., is not possible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll Road Sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between Ayabe Kita Honsen Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to travel only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section from Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
The current Ayabe Ankokuji IC has no tollbooth. This eliminates all tollbooths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyoto-Tanba Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. The management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The General National Route 9 Oinozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Kutsugaki IC to Chiyogawa IC was reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT - Maizuru-Oe IC section (provisional two-lane, opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections with a ■ background color in the IC number column indicate sections of road that are in service.
"Also, areas with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is not yet complete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
MUJI is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
&lt;Number&gt; is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, with the entire Mount Hiei, at an elevation of 848 meters, as its grounds."
"While it is officially called Enryaku-ji Temple, it is more commonly known as Mount Hiei, or sometimes as Mount Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongobuji Temple."
"It practiced the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land Buddhism, making it a comprehensive Buddhist university. In the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial Family and the aristocracy, becoming a powerful institution."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist rituals gained the support of the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple, belonging to the Shingon sect, was known as ""To-mitsu,"" while the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Dai-mitsu,"" and the two competed for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective name for the numerous halls and pagodas, including the East Tower, West Tower, and Yokawa, scattered throughout the grounds from the summit of Mount Hiei to its eastern foothills."
It began in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which takes its name from the era in which it was founded, was only granted in 824, fourteen years after Saicho's death."
"Enryakuji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, and is known as the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism"" because many founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history, such as Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo sect, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism, trained on Mount Hiei in their youth."
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training such as the ""12-year seclusion"" and the ""1,000-day mountain pilgrimage"" continues to this day, making it a prominent sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times, and the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, enshrines Ōyamagui no Kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuo no Obihiro, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or 767 according to some sources)."
"At the age of 15, in 780, the year of the Treasure Tortoise 11, he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a monk at the Omi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"Driven by his own convictions, the young Saicho, instead of seeking a secure position in a major temple in Nara, secluded himself on Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, devoting himself to rigorous training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho, considering the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures, studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystical Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Monju Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, naming it Ichijo Zokan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the name of the era, was granted only after Saicho's death, in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national protectorate, guarding the north-eastern gate of Kyoto, known as the ""Oni-mon."""
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a Gensekusho (short-term overseas trainee)."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804 AD.
"Saicho went to the sacred Mount Hiei, where he studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Furthermore, at the Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing), he studied esoteric Buddhism from Junkyo Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules over the night, there are alternative interpretations (discussed later)."
"The name can also be read as ""Tsukiyomi""."
"Although the Kojiki includes a story of the slaying of the food deity, Uke Mochi, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, there is no definitive description of its gender within the text."
"Many moon deities in other cultures are female, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, supporting the theory that the deity in question could be female."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing from the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the *Nihon Shoki* presents a different account, claiming that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, unlike the *Kojiki*, which states she was born from the right eye. The *Nihon Shoki* also mentions that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, and her dominion is not consistently described as heaven or sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, the sun goddess, is a concept echoed in various mythologies, as comparative mythology highlights."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as the same deity occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the sun and moon origin myth, a common motif found worldwide, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a significant deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall activity is limited."
"Only in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki"" is there a brief mention of the origin of grains."
There is also a theory that this balances the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo by placing a god who does nothing between them.
"Similar structures are also found in the relationship between Amenominakanushi no Kami and Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and in the relationship between Hosuseri and Hori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and another deity are the same god, as their domains and stories overlap in part."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, she is born from Izanagi's right eye and is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is ordered to ""inform the Land of Food of the night,"" but he has no further exploits after this."
There is also a theory that Izanami is in Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo section simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose brilliance rivaled the sun's, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book of the Kojiki states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While some accounts describe Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside another deity, others claim she was ordered to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" seemingly stemming from the belief that the moon controls tides. These multiple narratives about the birth of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the fifth section of the eleventh book of the Chronicles, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule heaven. Later, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi on high heaven, and he descended to Uke Mochi's presence."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, in an act of hospitality, vomited rice from her mouth, which angered Tsukiyomi no Mikoto, who then killed her with his sword."
"From the corpse of the food deity, oxen, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, and these became the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji is a title for an official who belonged to the Onmyōryō, a department of the Ministry of Central Affairs, under the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system."
"A position assigned to a technical officer who practiced divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, later expanding beyond the original legal regulations to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"After the medieval period, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""on'yōji"" without the sound change."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are formed by the combination of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. This philosophy, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendar, Yi Jing, and timekeeping, was transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan during the Asuka period, between the 5th and 6th centuries, no later than 512 AD (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when Yi Jing scholars arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little influence on politics and culture, in 602, Kanroku, who is considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured these studies to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, significantly impacting the nation's governance."
"The first adoption of a calendar (Genka-reki) as the official calendar in Japan, along with the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization, in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign) to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, marked a significant influence of these ideas on the subsequent establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the twelve-rank cap system."
"Thereafter, the court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the ships stopped, to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to determine auspicious and inauspicious events, as well as to obtain guidance for all aspects of life, by understanding the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and applying the principles of the Five Elements theory of mutual generation and mutual overcoming. Consequently, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of judging auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, and establishing behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of celestial divination and deeply versed in the Yin-Yang Five Elements theory, even using the *shi* (a divination tool) himself during the Jinshin War, established the ""Yin-Yang Office"" and Japan's first observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyoji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating a further flourishing of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought. In 718, the Yoro Code formally established the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with the permanent appointment of astronomers, Yin-Yang masters, calendar experts, and clock experts as technical officials. This placed Onmyo-ryo alongside the Shinto priests' divination as the official authority on divination."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the mainland were entrusted with such responsibilities. Each doctor and Onmyōji was appointed from among the immigrants who were well-versed in various disciplines and proficient in reading classical Chinese. These included scholars who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui (which had replaced them as the dominant power on the mainland), Goguryeo and Baekje (which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula), and occasionally Silla (which initially held power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula)."
"Particularly, after the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent an expeditionary force to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed. In the period surrounding this event, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees, and many of them were appointed to official positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Office's technical expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern-day ""Feng Shui""), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the use of clepsydras.  They primarily engaged in astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on the Yin Yang Five Elements theory.  They did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the court and divining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of locations and directions, which was particularly important during relocation of the capital."
