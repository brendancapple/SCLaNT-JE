"On the other hand, according to the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there is a tale that states Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" as well as a story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in her right hand, with dominion over varying realms such as the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born as a pair with Amaterasu, symbolizing the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (""Records of Five Perspectives of Ages""), there is a creation story where Pangu, after dying, became the left eye as the sun and the right eye as the moon. In Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are portrayed as twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later years that they were identified with each other."
"In addition, in Genesis of the Old Testament, on the fourth day of the creation of the heavens and the earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the expanse of the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and night respectively, and to separate light and darkness, the creation of the sun and the moon, is told."
It is thought that the birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi follows the pattern of the commonly shared myths of the origins of the sun and moon as being born in opposition to each other.
"In Japanese mythology, despite being considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susano-o, Tsukuyomi does not appear much in the myths of the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki, and is generally lacking in active role."
"the origin of grains is only mentioned briefly in the  Chronicles of Japan, fifth paragraph, eleventh book."
There is also a theory that balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can also be seen in relationships such as those between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, as well as between Hohori (who represents agriculture) and Hoderi (who represents fishing or marine resources).'"
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese myths.
"Some say Susano'o's domain and stories partially overlap, leading some to argue they are the same deity."
