"The Doshisha, a school corporation, encompasses Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College."
"Doshisha is a Christian school founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, based on the Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) faith. It is a comprehensive school with nine educational institutions bearing the name ""Doshisha"", ranging from universities to kindergartens (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 students are studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University is rated <AA+> by Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
&lt;AA+&gt; is the second highest ranking out of 21.
"Along with Waseda University and Keio University, it stands among the top educational institutions."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Jirō Shimada established the founding purpose of his school as ""to cultivate individuals who apply their conscience to their skills."""
"They desired to cultivate individuals with ""a conscience that permeates their whole being"" by fostering Christian-based ""moral education"" in parallel with knowledge education, so as to avoid an overemphasis on the latter."
"Monuments inscribed with his words, in his own handwriting, stand at Doshisha University and other schools."
"This monument to conscience bears the inscription, ""May strong men arise, filled with conscience from head to toe."""
"Moreover, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" has been put forward as a concrete realization of this ""conscience"" education, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation."""
It is a Christian Protestant school corporation with origins in the Congregationalist tradition.
"However, unlike so-called mission-oriented universities, its primary purpose is not Christian evangelization (it does not treat education as a means of evangelization)."

"""According to a secret tradition, Ikkyū Zenji was the fallen prince of Emperor Go-Komatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kashi, and Menggui."
"The Buddhist name is Soushun, also written as Soushun."
Ikyu is a Dharma name.
"(Refer to the ""Kaiten"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dokogo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgaishūgan at Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and received precepts, taking the name Zhoujian."
"His poetic talent emerged early, with his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass,"" written at age 13, and ""Spring Clothes Linger on Flowers,"" written at age 15, gaining renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and was given the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to the passing of his master, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"In 1415, he became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodun, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto."
"After answering the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Rice Sticks"" with ""From the having, I return to the non-having. Rest awhile, let it rain if it wants, let it blow if it wants,"" Ikkyu received the monastic name from Hwaso."
"""Avaroja (Ariroji)"" refers to the world of delusion (煩悩), while ""Muroji"" indicates the realm of enlightenment (仏)."

"In 1428, Emperor Shōkō died without leaving a male heir. Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was then welcomed to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation was behind Emperor Gokasho's enthronement.
"From ""The Chronicle of Ikkyū Sōjun, Priest of Tōkai."""
"However, Imazumi Shukuo argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyu's recommendation was irrelevant."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by an imperial decree from Emperor Gotsu. Although he did not reside in the temple, he dedicated himself to its reconstruction."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial residence located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
The Imperial Palace in Tokyo (former Edo Castle) was preserved in 1877 due to the Emperor's move to Tokyo following the Meiji Restoration.
"After the Meiji Restoration, it was also referred to as Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyō was located in the Inner Palace near the city center. However, due to wars and other conflicts, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Family moved to the Satō Inner Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Imperial Palace was one of the satsuki no in (provincial palaces) and served as the residence of the emperors of the Northern Court, later known as the Jimyōin-tō."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located within the Nijō-Tomikoji Palace."
"The present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact replica of the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"It is usually open to visitors by application, and also open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the 21st century is classified as ""Imperial Household Property,"" a state-owned asset under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace are adjacent, and across the street to the north, separated by Imadegawa-dori, lie Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campus)."
"The Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daigoku Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto residents often simply call the Kyoto Imperial Palace ""Gosho,"" including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden."
"However, unlike castles abroad, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high. This has been interpreted as a reflection of the different level of intimacy between the rulers (such as the Emperor and the Imperial family) and the commoners in Eastern and Western cultures."
"For instance, the absence of an event like the storming of the Palace of Versailles by commoners during the French Revolution, which served as the residence of the ruling monarch (king), is one of the bases for this analysis."
"The original imperial palace of Heian-kyō was located considerably further west than the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, northeast of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection, near the West Japan Railway Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as Tsuchimikado Higashi-tōindono. It was first used in 1331 by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period alone (six times due to fires), and the existing building was rebuilt in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian style, and is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In 1877, during a visit to Kyoto, Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair just ten years after his departure. He ordered the preservation of the Palace and the maintenance of its historic appearance."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokamonjo, Tsunegotem, Koshu, Oszumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their Enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify a particular location like Kyoto, and in 1990, during the enthronement of the present Emperor, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor, signifying his accession, is located in the Shishinden of Kyoto Imperial Palace. Thus, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi""), it was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-post gate with bare wood, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a 1-ken (bay) column spacing."
"The doors are opened only on special occasions, such as visits by the Emperor, dignitaries, or foreign guests, and during public openings."
"The two flanking earthen walls have five horizontal lines, a testament to their highest rank as walls."
"Upon entering this gate and passing through the vermillion-tiled Shōmeimon, the Shi Shinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea and Vietnam."
The following focuses on Japanese gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance"", contrasting with ""folk music""."
"According to the definition of the Imperial Household Agency's Bureau of Music, all pieces performed by the Bureau excluding Western music are considered Japanese music."
"Much of it is passed on as court music, primarily in instrumental forms."
It is the oldest form of traditional music in the world that is still performed today in large ensembles.
"However, the original ensemble form of gagaku, the traditional court music of Japan, was discontinued for over a century after the Ōnin War, until the Tokugawa shogunate reassembled the musicians' descendants (gakka) into a new group.  Therefore, it is questionable to what extent the form inherited from the Heian period is still practiced."
"It is surmised that the musical notation of the hichiriki, written in katakana, is quite faithfully reproduced in its rendition as shōga, including the characteristic Japanese pronunciation of the ha-row consonant sounds as fa, fi, fu, fe, and fo, which was prevalent before the 16th century."
"Music notation for the Raku Biwa, written in kanji characters, shares many similarities with Biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China. Furthermore, many ancient continental styles have been preserved."
"The most important historical document is ""Tai Gensho"", written by Toyohara Toyoaki (1450-1512), who lamented the loss of records on Gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other traditions during the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū, from the Sō no Gakuka family, compiled a record centered on the Shō (mouth organ) and focusing on Gagaku and Bugaku (Japanese court music and dance), offering a valuable record of early Gagaku."
"It originated from ceremonial music transmitted from China, the Korean peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, the Tang music played in Japanese gagaku today is said to be based on Yan music, which was performed at banquets during the Tang dynasty."
"The categories of music also include international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lâm Ấp music (Cham music), and elements of traditional Japanese music predating the transmission of music from the continent are also present."
"Prior to the modern period, the three principal music bureaus were the Tennoji Gakuso (Osaka) at Shitennoji Temple, which embodied the oldest style, the Ouchi Gakuso (Kyoto) at the Imperial Palace, and the Nanto Gakuso (Nara) at Kasuga Taisha Shrine."
"These music schools were later called ""Tokyo"" in the modern era, forming the basis for the current Imperial Household Agency's music clubs, while each school's traditions continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been mutually influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chanting, developing a uniquely Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces of music are preserved in the Shikibu-shogakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics reference the S-country style of song and dance.
Something that originated from outside of Japan (some argue that this is the only thing that can be called Gagaku).
"Left-Hand Dance, Tang Music... China, India, Lin-yi (Southern Vietnam) influences."
"Right Dance, Goryeo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China)"
These include songs (honkyoku) produced in Japan that imitate the above style.
Songs created during the Heian Period (Utai-mono)
Lyrics are based on traditional Japanese music.
*Koku-fu Kabuki* and *Yōkyoku* are sometimes collectively referred to as *Kodai Kayō*.
Emperor Kanmu (737–806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakawa, who later became Emperor Kōnin."
"According to the Shoku Nihongi, Mother Takano's new kasa [hat] lineage is traced back to the Baekje royal family, whose ancestor was King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu, bore Ando (later Emperor Heijo), and Kano (later Emperor Saga); Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko, bore Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Shirakabe, ascended the throne, his mother, Konoe Shinryo, was of lowly descent, a naturalized clan from the Washi family. This meant that he was not expected to become the Crown Prince, and he initially focused on a career in government, serving as a Chamberlain, University Head, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, he was suddenly made Crown Prince on January 2, 773, after his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Otomo, and his mother, Empress Injo, were abruptly deposed in a power struggle involving the Fujiwara clan and others."
"The capital was moved to Yamashiro Province, fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo."
"Heian-kyo was constructed in 794, after having previously constructed Nagaoka-kyo in 784."
"To further invade the Tohoku region and subdue the Ezo people, they sent an army under the command of Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, appointing him as the Sei-i Taishōgun."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi, a member of the Fujiwara family, for the military and construction projects that were causing hardship to the farmers."
"He is said to have proposed the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of cultural impact."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing with them new impetus for Buddhism in Japan."
"The reign of [Emperor Kanmu] was marred by the suspicious deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todono, and by the exile and subsequent death of his younger brother, Prince Sawara, who had been designated Crown Prince. In 785, Prince Sawara was banished for the supposed assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継, an incident that cast a dark shadow over the early years of the reign."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Emperor Kanmu posthumously conferred the title of ""Emperor Sudo"" upon Prince Sawara, designated the tomb of Empress Inoue as an Imperial mausoleum, and restored her title of Empress."
"While known for protecting Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Schools of Nara,"" by confiscating their estates and other forms of oppression, due to their deep entanglement with the government and the excessive power they wielded."
"It is also said that the harem's chaos contributed to the later ""Incident of Yakushi,"" serving as a breeding ground for it."
"Passed away on March 17th, 806 (year 25 of the Enryaku era)."
He was bestowed with the Japanese posthumous name Yamatonekoa Matsuhitsugiya derinomikoto.
"He was posthumously given the Chinese-style諡号, ""Emperor Kanmu""."
He was also known as Emperor Kashiwabara and Emperor Kashiwabara of the Heavenly Kingdom.
"The mausoleum is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"Although he insisted on being buried in Utanoyama after his death, he was interred in the Kashiwara Imperial Tomb in Fushimi due to divination."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyō during the Meiji period.
"All emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three sanctuaries within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in a customary press conference before the Emperor's Birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments on Japan co-hosting the following year's FIFA World Cup, mentioned, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea because the *Shoku Nihongi* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it became a major news story and sparked discussion in Korean media."
"Some media outlets went as far as to claim that the Imperial family is of Korean descent and propagated the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origins Theory."""
"The Otani family is a lineage descended from Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsuna Hino was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who succeeded the headship (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji, the mainstream sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"In the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha ( Nishi Honganji ) and the head priest of the True Pure Land sect, Otani-ha, which separated in 1602 ( Shin Shu Honbyo), adopted a surname."
"The surname Otani originates from the establishment of Shinran's mausoleum in Ootani, located north of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Although the Honganji Temple wielded power comparable to warlords during the Sengoku period (Japan) due to the spread of the Ikkō-ikki, and is often counted as one of the warlords, the temple's head priest's Dharma name (Pure Land Buddhism) or personal name sometimes bore the suffix ""Honganji,"" like ""Honganji Kennyo"" and ""Honganji Kōsa."" However, this is merely for convenience, and neither did the Honganji Temple's family take Honganji as their surname nor did a ""Honganji clan"" ever exist."
"Jaku Shin-ni, who had witnessed the passing of Shinran in 1262, built a hall to house his remains in 1272 near her home in Ohtani on the eastern slopes of Kyoto."
"The Ootani Temple, housing the mausoleum of Shinran, became the revered Ootani Mausoleum for the followers of Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, and Kaiei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, assumed the responsibility of managing it as caretaker."
"However, as the Ohtani Temple attracted pilgrims and donations from all over the country, a dispute later arose over the vacant post between Kakunyo, the son of Kakuei, and Taizen, Kakuei's half-brother.  Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the vacant post by his lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the temple into a monastery, giving birth to the Otani Hongwanji Temple."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji temple, inherited by the descendants of Kennyo, proceeded to build a religious organization, advancing into the Hokuriku region during the reign of the 5th abbot, Shaknyo, in the Muromachi period. By the time of the 7th abbot, Jonnyo, the Hongan-ji sect had been established in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that had actively formed their own sects after the death of Shinran, the formation of Hongan-ji was significantly delayed.  In the early Muromachi period, Hongan-ji was considered a subsidiary temple of Shoren-in. It is also said that the Otani family, due to their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), had served as an equivalent of a steward for the Kujo family."
"The Jodo Shinshu sect, under the leadership of the 8th abbot Rennyo, expanded across Japan in the late 15th century, but after the Otani Hongan-ji was destroyed in 1465, the abbot relocated to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to Yamashina, outside Kyoto."
"In Kaga, fueled by the expansion of Rennyo's religious movement, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki rebellion erupted in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the ruling Togashi clan and establishing a state known as ""ruled by the peasants."""
"For about a hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikkō sect."
"In the 16th century, amid the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, wielding its organizational power reaching from small farmers to samurai and local lords, rapidly expanded its activities across Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke War.  The 10th abbot, Shonyo, then moved to the Ishiyama Gobo in Nishinari District, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka), established by Rennyo, which became known as Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji temple was located at the summit of the hill on the northern edge of the Uemachi plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic river transportation hub at the mouth of the Yodogawa River."
"From his base at Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shonyo forged strong alliances with major lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court, solidifying the temple's power base."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōko era, within the Honganji sect, especially in the Hokuriku region and elsewhere, some began to deviate from the control of the Honganji Temple and forge their own path."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kannon, the Honganji sect, which had de facto become an independent daimyo power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to conquer the Kinai region and establish unified rule by seizing territorial authority from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that began in 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand through the combined strength of Kannon's entrenched position in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple and the support of Honganji followers who resisted Oda forces across the land, significantly hampering Nobunaga's ambitions."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji temple in Nagashima, Ise province (Mie prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikkō-ikki, which had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, extinguishing resistance in various places. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with Honganji, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, and Honganji began to suffer repeated defeats outside its own domain."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple remained strong with continued support from the Saika-shu and others, it gradually became isolated amidst enemies. Finally, in 1580, it yielded to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and vacated Ishiyama Hongan-ji. This marked the end of Hongan-ji Temple's authority as a territorial power."
"At this time, Kyo-nyo, the eldest son, argued for continuing resistance against the wishes of Ken-nyo, leading to a rift between them. After Ken-nyo's death in 1593, his third son, Jun-nyo, was chosen as his successor."
"From this point, the Hongwanji Temple embarked on a path of division over the position of head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Jōruri a separate temple site and established the Higashi Hongwanji Temple, separating it from the Hongwanji Temple led by Junnyo."
"At this time, many followers left Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, for Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to the division of the Honganji temple into two branches."
"Both the eastern and western Otani families, heads of which descend from Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arihisa, and Hino Hirotsuna (the father of Kakunyo), have a long tradition of adopting children from influential court nobles, and also intermarrying with them, thus leading to their increasing court noble connections through the maternal line."
"Kyoutanabe City is located in southern Kyoto Prefecture, near the border with Osaka and Nara Prefectures."
"Kyotanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Jyo-yo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, at the center of a triangular region encompassing the three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, flowing north-south on the city's east side, and the Ikoma Mountains to the west, the city is traversed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line through its center."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are primarily considered bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), became a city from Tsuzuki County, Tanabe Town."
"It was established as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years, and the 669th in Japan."
"On the same day, the town of Tanabe in Tsuchiya District, Kyoto Prefecture, was elevated to city status (municipal implementation) as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to avoid duplication with Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, with ""Kyō"" from ""Kyoto"" prepended to its name, and the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyōtanabe City""."
"However, the new city name was selected from public nominations."

The seated statue of Ikkū Sōjun and the scenic garden are designated Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's representative stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyoutanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the central stations for Kyotanabe city, while Matsuiyamaguchi Station serves as the central station for Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"Also, Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station is served by ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line."
"JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name almost at the same time as the city's establishment."
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishimukai Station and Higashimukai Station.
"While the Kii Tanabe Station (on the Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii,"" the old country name of Wakayama, in the station name likely serves to avoid duplication with other stations under the jurisdiction of West Japan Railway Company."

"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces under the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama and Tokyo Prefectures, excluding islands, plus the northeastern portion of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki and eastern and coastal Yokohama)."

"Heian-kyō, established in 794 AD by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō was a walled city constructed on land straddling across Katsura and Atago counties in Yamashiro Province, corresponding to the central area of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture today. The city was laid out in a rectangular shape measuring 4.5km east-west and 5.2km north-south."
"The Imperial Palace was located in the north-central part of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing the city into left and right sections (the east side being the left section, the west side the right)."
The floor plan basically follows Heijo-kyo and imitates Chang'an of the Sui and Tang dynasties.
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony,"" which originated in Chinese Feng Shui."
The Heian-kyō area was smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost main street, Ichijou-Oji, is Ichijou-dori, located between present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Ninth Avenue of the southern limit is currently Kujo Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's main road corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the western limit of Saikyo-ku Oji is the line connecting the JR San-in Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hankyu Railway Hankyu Kyoto Line Saikyo-ku Station north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""machi"" blocks, each measuring 40 jo (about 120 meters) square, by a grid of large and small streets running north-south and east-west."
"A row of four towns lined up east to west, excluding the two rows on the north side, is called a ""jo"", and a column of four towns lined up north to south is called a ""bo""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each assigned a number.
"This resulted in each town being named as, for example, ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho."""
"The width of the roads was at least four zhang (about 12 meters) even for alleys, and over eight zhang (about 24 meters) for major roads."
Existing roads within Kyoto City are much narrower in most places than this.
It reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters) at Suzaku Avenue.
"Moreover, rivers (Horikawa, Nishihorikawa) ran parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishihorikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"It is said that the establishment of this new capital aimed to break away from Yamato province, the stronghold of the aristocracy and Buddhist temples that had supported the Tenmu line of emperors, and create a new center for the Tenji lineage."
"However, only 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of disturbances, ranging from the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane tsugu, who rose in Nagaoka-kyo, to the demotion of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have started with the Imperial Palace (Dairi) and then proceeded to the city (city streets).
The right-bank region of Kyoto remained largely undeveloped even into the 9th century because it lay within a wetland area shaped by the Katsura River (a tributary of the Yodo River).
"By the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become a shell of its former self, the capital was in decline, with some land even being turned over to farming, an activity forbidden within the city walls."
"The residential areas for the aristocracy were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the imperial palace."
"The Nihon Kōki is a history of Japan compiled during the early Heian period. It is the third of the six national histories, following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it records 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
"The editors are Fujiwara Tsuguo, et al."
"According to the preface, in the year 819, during the reign of Emperor Saga, he commanded Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryosen no Yasushi to compile it."
"Three of the five, except for Otsu, died before the task was completed, leading Emperor Junwa to order Kiyohara Natsuo, Naoyoshi-ou, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mine-mori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue the work."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, he further issued an edict and commanded Fujiwara Tsugushi, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori to carry it out."
"Afterward, adding Furu Taka-niwa and Yamada Koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9, Jowa 7 (January 5, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and Fujiwara no Ototsugu alone dedicated himself to this project, spanning three reigns."
"Continuing after the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" it records the reigns of Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna, beginning from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the collection was scattered until the early 15th century.  It was rediscovered by Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of Hanawa Hokiichi, in the Sanjo-nishi family (though some say it was discovered in a corrected version by Yanagihara Kikino).  This 10-volume copy was the first version published."
"The extant volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), for a total of ten volumes. The era of Emperor Junna is entirely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the *Nihon Kiryaku*, a selection of the Six National Histories, to a certain extent by citing passages from the *Ruiju Kokushi*, which classifies entries from the Six National Histories by subject matter."
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsubun,"" which are the basis for the following works published by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
The content is said to have been most influenced by the opinion of Fujiwara no Osushi.
"The practice of adding brief biographies (kōden) to the death notices of emperors and court officials, as seen in the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was followed by subsequent historical texts."
"However, this book's account of the Emperor's death avoids the typical one-sided official praise or condemnation, instead offering many intriguing observations and critiques. This makes it stand out among the Six National Histories for its sustained spirit of criticism."
"It is known that the Rikkokushi, compared to historical texts that came before and after it, included a larger number of waka poems."
Sei Shonagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet during the Heian period.
"Her real name is said to be Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Ki no Motosuke (908 - 990), a famous waka poet and one of the ""Five of the Pear Jar."""
"There is an old legend that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ōna"" appearing in the ""Gosen Wakashū,"" but it's simply an absurd theory."
"My great-grandfather (or possibly my grandfather, according to some accounts) was Ki no Tomoyori, a renowned poet of the Kokin Wakashū anthology."
"Among their siblings are the Music Director, Tainari, the Assistant Minister of the Left, Hisanobu, Priest Kaishuu of the Kazan'in Palace, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara Noritoshi (brother of Fujiwara Michinaga's mother)."
"Seishōnagon is a court lady's name, ""Sei"" derived from the family name Kiyohara, and ""Shōnagon"" from the title held by her relative."
"Her real name is unknown. Some say it was ""Nagiko"" (according to ""Makura no Sōshi""), but this is not credible."
"Considered one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she is known for her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Anthology of Sei Shonagon,"" which has been transmitted down (the number of poems differs depending on the manuscript. In the most common version, there are 31)."
"Included in the following imperial anthologies: ""Goshūi Wakashū"" and fourteen other collections."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate (reign: 1568–1588).
"His father was the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"His mother was Keiju-in, daughter of Konoe Nobuto."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his elder brother."
"Although he had initially entered the priesthood, he escaped from Kyoto with the aid of the Shogun's retainers, including Hosokawa Yuzai, after Yoshiaki was assassinated by Matsu permanent Hideyoshi and others."
"He then ascended to the throne as the 15th Shogun, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, coordinating with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to form a siege network around Nobunaga."
"Though they initially cornered Nobunaga, they were eventually expelled from Kyoto by him, effectively ending the Muromachi Shogunate."
He then spent the rest of his life with the help of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"He was born on November 13, 1537, the second son of Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun."
"Having a brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at Kofukuji Ichijoin Temple) as a foster son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, and adopted the name Kakkei at a young age."
He was later promoted to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Hōkō-ji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of 1565, the 13th shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsu永久秀 and the Three  Mihara Generals, while his younger brother, Sōshū, the abbot of Rokuen-in temple, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was captured by Matsu permanent Hisahide and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and his men feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Jōkei, who was the brother of the shogun and was promised the position of Abbot of Kofukuji Temple in the future, so they chose to imprison him instead.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa and, on February 17th, 1566, he renounced his priestly vows and assumed the name Yoshiaki."
"Books documenting Yoshiaki refer to him by alternate titles such as ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was driven from Kyoto and, during his exile, was attacked by thieves and came to be known as the ""poor shogun."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to the rank of Jushi no ge, and appointed to the position of Sama no Kami."
"However, while the exact date of his appointment remains in question, Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki"" records that on February of 1568, the day Ashikaga Yoshiaki's rival, Yoshiei, was appointed Shogun, Tokitsugu, who was the envoy for the appointment, received a visit from Yoshiaki's envoy who requested his mediation in securing Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi-no-ge (Junior Fourth Rank). Tokitsugu records that he was perplexed by the request, implying Yoshiaki had already received the appointment prior to this."
"Having fled Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku father and son, Yoshikata and Yoshiharu, in Omi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly conspired with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu was forced to seek asylum with his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitaka, in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan, weakened by internal feuds and power struggles among their senior retainers, lacked the strength to make the journey to Kyoto. In September, they fled to the province of Echizen and sought the aid of Asakura Yoshikage, hoping for his help in restoring their family to power."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomu, a branch of the Ashikaga shogun family at ""Kuradani Gosho,"" and had no intention of actively ascending to Kyoto with the recently-resigned Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the ascent did not happen."
"The role of crowning prince was played by Asakura Yoshikage. (Note, there are no historical documents proving that Yoshiaki formally came of age at this point, making it an unusually late ceremony.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province seeking the patronage of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, backed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18, he was appointed the 15th shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Sangi and Left Division Middle Guard General."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company's (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been used since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway and also parallels the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of the Kintetsu Railway, both connecting Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station. To avoid confusion, the name ""JR"" is used as a nickname."
"The line color is blue (■), and as a main line alongside the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka, a 42.8km distance, in as little as 28 minutes, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line along the right bank of the Yodo River at a maximum speed of 130km/h."
"The entire section is quadruple track with separate direction quadruples (outer track, inner track)."
"All stations on the JR Kyoto Line accept J-Thru, ICOCA, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) Suica, Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with a Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates integrally with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line operates local trains (Kyokanshin Local), rapid trains, express trains running through to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, as well as limited express trains serving areas like Hokuriku, Kansai International Airport, and San'in."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"Following the JR privatization, the number of express trains operating on this section increased dramatically, with newly introduced through services including overnight express trains from Shin-Osaka to Kyushu, limited express trains from Tennoji to the Kii Peninsula, and the ""Hakuto"" limited express trains to the San-in region launched after the opening of the Chizu Express line, all extended to Kyoto."
"Specifically, the Haruka train, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, became fully integrated into Kyoto service within a year, establishing a ""special express corridor"" between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto, with approximately four trains per hour operating alongside other trains like the Hokuriku-bound ""Raicho"" express."
"However, all sleeper trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued with the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"However, down-bound limited express trains such as ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line after passing through the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka Station enter the freight line at Ibaraki Station (third departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita Signal Box."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains that run on the outer tracks, and in some time slots, two express trains can arrive at Shin-Osaka simultaneously."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, with speeds of 130 km/h possible on most of the outer tracks, excluding certain curved sections."
"The inner track is also rated for 120km/h, but express trains never run on it (though some empty trains and special trains do)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, freight trains such as ""Hamakaze"", ""Tamba"" and ""Hokkinoki"" run through this section in relation to their entry and departure from Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot)."
"The ""Thunderbird"", ""Raicho"", and ""Kitaguni"" empty trains between Mukomachi and Osaka run via the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is brought into Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka station, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Hokubu Freight Line from the west, and then merges with the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is taken when leaving.)"
"Therefore, when entering or leaving the depot, the front and back of the train are reversed."
"The New Rapid service runs direct from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line and Omi-Shiotsu on the Hokuriku Line."
"From noon to night, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one daytime service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three operating directly on the Biwako Line in Kyoto direction."
"At night, all four lines run direct to the Biwako Line."
All trains operate with 8 or 12-car formations using JR West Series 223 1000 and 2000 trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100 kilometers, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478) starting in Kumiyama Town, Kuse District, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, the same prefecture."
"It runs through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, strengthening ties between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region while also serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto Metropolitan Area, whose high-standard road network is weak."
"The Governor of Kyoto refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open, the starting point, center, and ending point. The starting point section opened under the name of Kei-Shi Bypass, not Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The main line portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side will not terminate here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional expressway, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section between Kumoyama Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so a minimum speed limit applies and travel by small motorcycles is prohibited."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooei IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll roads (Ayabe Miyazu Road: Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others: West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe-Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe-Angokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the free section."
"The section of the highway from Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji IC, scheduled to open in summer or fall 2008, is planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the section from Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT will also be managed by the Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation. Therefore, the currently free section from Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is scheduled to become a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita-honsen toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Angokuji toll booth will be newly constructed."
"The current Ayabe Angokuji IC now lacks a tollbooth, thus eliminating all tollbooths on the Ayabe Miyazu Road mainline."
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) is currently constructed in a temporary prefabricated manner.
"The Tanba IC - Kyotanabe Wachi IC section is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism with a projected opening date in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after its opening remains undetermined."
"February 17, 1988:  National Route 9  Oinozuka Kameoka Road (Kutsukari IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, while National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Katakake IC to Chiyogawa IC is re-designated from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC - Chiyodagawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now the Maizuru-Wakasa Expressway) via the opening of the Ayabe Junction - Maizuru-Ooe Interchange section (two-lane divided carriageway)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations responsible for road management were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Agency Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a ■ background in the IC Number column indicate roads that are in service.
"Furthermore, facility names with a background color of ■ indicate that the facility is not in use or has not been completed."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Plain and simple.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the reservation number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompassing the entire 848m-high Mount Hiei as its grounds."
"While often called Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei, or simply Eizan, is more commonly known."
"It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto), and was also known as Hokurei."
"It is the head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
"The abbot (chief abbot), also known as the Tendai Zasū, oversees the affiliated temples."
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside the Kongobuji Temple on Mount Koya."
"It encompassed teachings of Tendai, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (Shikan), and Nembutsu, showcasing a comprehensive range of Buddhist practices, becoming akin to a Buddhist university. It gained immense influence in the Heian period, earning the patronage of the Imperial Family and aristocracy."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist practices and rituals gained significant support among the Heian aristocracy, with the esoteric Buddhism of Tōji Temple (Shingon sect), known as ""Tōmitsu,"" vying for dominance with the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, known as ""Daimitsu."""
"Enryakuji Temple refers to the scattered buildings, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and others within its grounds, which extend from the summit of Mount Hiei to the eastern foothills."
"It originated in 788 AD, when Saicho established a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"", incorporating the year of its founding, was not granted until the year 824, the 14th year of the Kōnin era, after Saichō's death."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced countless eminent monks, including Ennin, Enchin who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent monks in the history of Japanese Buddhism trained at Mt. Hiei in their youth, earning the mountain the name ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism""."
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, it continues to host rigorous training such as the ""12-year seclusion in the mountains"" and the ""1000-day circumambulation of Mt. Hiei"", and as a leading center of Japanese Buddhism, it has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the Kojiki, is believed to have been a sacred mountain since ancient times, dedicated to mountain worship. The Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto, on the mountain's eastern slopes, enshrines Ōyama-tsumi no kami, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuobe Hiro, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in the second year of the Tenpyo Jingō era (766 AD) (some accounts give 767 AD as his birth year)."
"At the age of 15, in the eleventh year of the Hōki era (780), he received the tonsure (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji temple and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of twenty, in the year 785, he received the precepts (became a fully ordained monk) at Todai-ji Temple in Nara."
"Young Saicho, for reasons of his own, eschewed a secure position at a major temple in Nara and instead chose to immerse himself in training and scripture study in seclusion on Mount Hiei, close to his hometown."
"Saicho, believing the Lotus Sutra to be the highest of all scriptures, studied the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" (**""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,""** **""The Words of the Lotus Sutra,""** **""The Great Cessation and Contemplation""**) written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788 AD, Saicho established a small temple, called Ichijo Zokanin, on the present site of the Hojo-chudo Hall, consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Monju Hall, and a Sutra Repository."
"This temple, also known as Hieizan-ji, was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took its name from the era, only after the death of Saicho, in the year 824 (the 14th year of the Kōnin era)."
"Emperor Kanmu, during his reign, became a devotee of Saicho. With the Emperor's patronage and the support of the Wake clan, his close advisors, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national protectorate, safeguarding Kyoto from evil influences in its northeast sector (鬼門)."
"In 802 AD, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang China as a ""Gengakushō"", a student on a short-term overseas study program."
He traveled to Tang Dynasty on a Japanese envoy ship in 804 AD.
"Saicho journeyed to Mt. Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Great Vehicle Bodhisattva Precepts from Dousui, a direct descendant of the Tendai Master Zhiyi, and studied Tendai teachings from Goman, the presiding abbot."
"Furthermore, he studied esoteric Buddhism from Ajari Shunkyo at Ryukoji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing), and Zen from Zen Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules over night, there are alternate interpretations (see below)."
The name can also be read as Tsukiyomi.
"The Nihongi includes a story about the slaying of the food deity, leading to the general perception of him as a male god, despite no clear indication of his gender in the chronicle itself."
"In many other mythologies, the moon deity is often a goddess, and there are also many examples of aggressive goddesses. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the killing of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and propose that she may have been a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but different texts offer varying accounts of his divine nature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, upon escaping the underworld, cleansed himself and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye, Tsukiyomi, and from his nose, Susanoo, forming the three great deities."
"On the other hand, in the *Nihon Shoki*, unlike the *Kojiki*, there are accounts of Amaterasu being born from the left eye, or emerging from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, and her dominion is also inconsistent, encompassing heaven, sea, and other realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born alongside Amaterasu who symbolizes the sun, is an example of a recurring concept in comparative mythology, with similar ideas found across various myths."
"For example, the Chinese Pangu legend (in the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji"") tells of Pangu's death, his left eye becoming the sun and his right eye the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate deity from Helios, the sun god, and their identification occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created the ""two great lights"" in the heavens, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them the dominion over day and night, respectively, thus separating light from darkness—this is the story of the creation of the sun and the moon."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can also be considered to follow the pattern of sun-moon origin myths found all over the world, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered an important deity in Japanese mythology, alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, Tsukiyomi has limited appearances in both the Kojiki and Nihonshoki, and overall has a lack of noteworthy activities."
"The only mention of the origin of grain is found in a single passage of the fifth book, eleventh chapter of the Nihon Shoki."
There is also a theory that this is balanced by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"Similar structures can be found in other mythologies, such as the relationship between Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and the relationship between Hosuseri, Hoori (Yamasachihiko) and Hodeli (Umi-sachihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [another god] are the same deity, as their domains and certain episodes overlap."
"Born from Izanagi's washing of his right eye in the Upper Volume of the Kojiki, this being is called ""the three noble children,"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is ordered to ""report on the land of food at night,"" but there is no further record of his deeds."
There is also a theory that Izanami-no-mikoto is in Yomi-no-Kuni.
"While the Fifth Section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo Period simply states that the divine couple created a moon god, ""whose brilliance rivaled the sun's,"" and sent it to the heavens to rule alongside the sun, the later First Book's alternative tradition relates that Izanagi held a white bronze mirror in his left hand when he gave birth to Ōhirume no Mikoto (the sun goddess), and a white bronze mirror in his right hand when he gave birth to Tsukiyumi no Mikoto (the moon god)."
"While there are several accounts of Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside the other gods, there are also stories of her being commanded to ""rule the eight hundred tides of the boundless sea,"" which appears to stem from the idea that the moon controls the tides. These multiple narratives surrounding the birth of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the eleventh chapter of the fifth scroll, Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi were both commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi in the heavens.  Tsukiyomi descended to the earth and went to Uke Mochi."
"There is a myth where the Food Goddess offered food from her mouth as hospitality, and the Moon God, Tsukiyomi, was angered, calling it ""unclean,"" and killed her with his sword."
"From the corpse of the Food Deity were born oxen, horses, silkworms, and rice, marking the origin of grain."
"Onmyoji was a government position in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryo system, belonging to the Onmyoryo division within the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"An official appointed based on the principles of Yin-Yang and Five Elements, using Yin-Yang Dao for divination, geomancy, and other technical skills. This position eventually expanded beyond its original legal framework, taking charge of divination, sorcery, and rituals in their entirety."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who engage in divination, sorcery, and rituals in private settings. Today, it is defined as a type of clergy who practice private prayer and divination in a non-official capacity."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without linking the sounds."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which posits that all phenomena are formed by a combination of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements, originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou Dynasty. Closely related fields such as astronomy, calendrical systems, the Yi Jing (Book of Changes), and timekeeping, were transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties), or indirectly via the Korean Peninsula and Western Regions (Goguryeo and Baekje), between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Asuka period in Japan, by no later than 512 AD (Year 7 of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (Year 15 of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when an Yi Jing scholar arrived."
"Although their initial influence on politics and culture was minimal, these studies gained significant influence in Japan when Kannon, considered the pioneer of Yin-Yang in Japan, arrived from Baekje in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko's reign) and lectured to 34 carefully selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, leading to a profound impact on national governance."
"The adoption of the Yuanjia calendar as the official calendar in Japan marked the beginning of its integration with Chinese culture. To learn about Buddhism, yin-yang and Five Elements philosophy, and calendrical methods, the first embassy to Sui Dynasty China was dispatched in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign). The Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve-rank cap system also bear strong traces of the influence of yin-yang and Five Elements thought."
"Even afterwards, the court continued its pursuit of knowledge, sending students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang), and inviting numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the Korean peninsula's western coast to Japan."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines advanced in Japan, the importance of ""understanding the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, applying the principles of the Five Elements (五行思想) to judge auspiciousness, misfortune, and calamity, and obtaining guidance for all human affairs"" came to be recognized. Consequently, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of determining fortune and misfortune, and establishing guidelines for behavior."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, renowned for his expertise in astrology and Yin-Yang philosophy – as demonstrated by his practice of using divination during the Jinshin Rebellion – established the ""Yin-Yang Bureau"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 AD (the 4th year of his reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyoji"" began in 685 AD (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), marking the further flourishing of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought. In 718 AD, the Yoro Code formally established the Onmyo-ryo as a department within the Ministry of Central Affairs, and its staffing with permanent technicians including Astronomer, Onmyoji Doctor, Onmyoji, Calendar Doctor, and Clepsydra Doctor made divination, alongside the kami priests' tortoise-shell divination, an official function of the state."
"Only those skilled in the techniques introduced from the mainland were appointed as instructors, and these included scholars, Onmyōji, and returned scholars from various countries, all proficient in the various sciences and well-versed in classical Chinese. They were typically from the Han dynasty (both Western and Eastern), Sui which held hegemony over the mainland, Goguryeo and Baekje which held power over the western coast of the Korean peninsula, and rarely Silla, the initial eastern power on the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly, following the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), where Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula, leading to the demise of the Baekje dynasty. This event triggered a significant influx of intellectuals and refugees from Baekje into Japan, many of whom were subsequently appointed to official positions."
"Initially, the Onmyōryō's skills were purely limited to divination, geomancy (what we now call Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar making, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the use of clepsydras. Therefore, their primary focus was on astronomical observations, timekeeping, and predicting the good or bad fortune of events through theoretical analysis based on Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. They did not perform any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, their role was crucial in selecting auspicious dates for construction projects at the imperial court, determining the good or bad fortune of land and direction, and ultimately playing a vital role during relocations of the capital city."
