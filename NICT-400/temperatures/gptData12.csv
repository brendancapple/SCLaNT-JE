"Born in Kyoto, said to be an illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado."
"In the diary of Sugawara Michitada and Nagachika, in the entry for August 1st of the 3rd year of Meio (1494), it says, ""It is said in a secret tradition that the monk Ikkyu is a prince born of the Emperor Gotsuchimikado.""."
"""There is no one in the world who knows it."""
"Her childhood name was Chigikumaru, according to later historical sources."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, called Crazy Cloud Child, Blind Donkey, Dream Court, and other names."
"Posthumous name is Shujun, also can be written as Shunjun."
Ikkyu is a Buddhist name.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist names"" section for information on issued posthumous names and temple names."
"At the age of six, he entered the Jizo-in Temple in Kyoto and received the tonsure, and was named Zhou Jian."
"With an early talent for poetry, his Chinese poems ""Chomon Harukusa"" composed at the age of thirteen, and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Flowers"" at fifteen, gained praise and popularity in the city of Kyoto."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Kenou Soi and changed his name to Soshun."
"At this time, it is unclear whether Ikkyu's actions are due to his master's death, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of the Ōei era (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a high priest of the Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto."
"He received the Buddhist name of Ikkyu from Kaso after responding to the koan of ""The Stick of Dongshan Threetimes"" with the words: ""Returning from the place where there is none to the place where there is one — resting. When it rains, let it rain when the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""In addition, 'aroji' refers to the world of afflictions (samsara), while 'muroji' refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."""
"One night in the 27th year of the Oei era (1420), upon hearing the cawing of a crow, I suddenly come to a great realization."
"The old man tried to give a letter of approval to Ikkyu, but he refused."
It is said that the old man sent him off laughing as a fool.
"Later on, I lived a life of poetry, mad songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shōchō (1428), Emperor Kōkō passed away without leaving any male heirs, and Emperor Go-Hanazono was installed from the Fushimi-no-miya line."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Goharazara.
"From ""The Chronological Record of Master Ikkyu of the East Sea""."
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono was supported by the shogunate and was unrelated to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the 6th year of the Bunmei era (1474) after the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the 47th chief priest of Daitokuji by the imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and although he did not reside at the temple, he made efforts for its revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"As a result of Emperor Meiji's visit to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), and it has been preserved since Meiji 10 (1877)."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been called the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of the city but moved to the Takakura-Sakyo district due to various conflicts which led to its deterioration."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashinoin Palace was one of the palaces in this village, where the Imperial family of the Jimuinkinhira Dynasty, later known as the Northern Court, resided in generations."
"Incidentally, the Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line of emperors, which is called the Minami Court, was located in Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Dōshin-dai of the Tojoji Emperor, but an expanded version based on the Dōshin-dai of the Tojoji Emperor."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Imperial Court relocated to Tokyo in Meiji 2 (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in present times (21st century) is classified as ""Imperial Properties"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency and is owned by the government."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace, Sentō Imperial Palace, and on the north side of Imadegawa Street, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both located on the Imadegawa Campus)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Sento Imperial Palace, and Sentogi Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Many residents of Kyoto often refer to it simply as ""Gosho,"" including the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"However, unlike overseas castles, the walls covering the Imperial Palace are not very high. There is a theory that this difference is due to the different sense of intimacy between the common people and the rulers (Emperor and Imperial family) in the East and West."
"For example, during the French Revolution, there was an incident where commoners invaded Versailles Palace, which was the residence of the ruler (king). This is one of the reasons why such events have not occurred in Japan."
"The first Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located significantly west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near the Nijo Station of the West Japan Railway Company, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences called Sato-Dairi, and was known as the Doimimimoto In Emperor Gonryo. It was first used by Emperor Komyo of the Northern Court in the first year of Genko (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was located here has been rebuilt 8 times only in the Edo period (6 of which were rebuilt due to fires), and the existing building was rebuilt in the late Edo period in the 2nd year of Ansei (1855) in the Heian style and is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of the Meiji era (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating condition of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the palace to be preserved and its original appearance to be maintained."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Egakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress's Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held at the Shishin-den in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the former Imperial House Law established in the 22nd year of the Meiji era (1889), it was stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai Ceremony are to be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their Enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Also, there are no specific provisions in the current Imperial Household Law that the enthronement ceremony must be held in Kyoto, which was established after World War II. In 1990, for the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony for the current Emperor was held at the main hall of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor takes his seat at the Takamikura, which is the official throne of the Emperor symbolizing his enthronement, located in the Shishin-den of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. For the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony ""Shin-den no gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishin-den no gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"It is a four-legged gate with a pointed gable roof, cypress bark thatch, and 1-ken pillar spacing."
"The gate is opened only for special occasions such as the visit of the Emperor, dignitaries, or foreign guests, as well as for public openings."
The left and right Tsukiji fences have five lines (horizontal lines) that indicate the highest level of formality as a fence.
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-lacquered roof tiles of the Shoumei Gate, you will see the front of the Purple Hall."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on the Japanese court music Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Asset) passed down to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu.
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance"", in contrast to ""popular music""."
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu, it excludes Western music from the repertoire performed by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-shoku Gakubu."
Many of them have been inherited as court music in instrumental music.
It is the oldest style of traditional music performed in large ensemble form even now.
"However, as a form of ensemble as originally performed in Gagaku, it had been interrupted for over 100 years since the Onin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate began to reorganize the descendants of court musicians. Therefore, it is questionable to what extent it has inherited the form of the Heian period."
"When singing a melody using the katakana notation of the shōga (shōga), in which the musical notation is marked with phrases to chant the melody, the pronunciation of the Ha line is pronounced as Fafa Fifu Feifo, etc., faithfully reproducing the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century. It is speculated that it is overall quite faithfully reproduced."
"The characters used in notation similar to that of the Raku biwa score have many similarities to the biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and many styles passed down from an even older continent are also inherited."
"One of the most important historical documents is ""Taigen Shou"" written by Toyohara Matoshi (1450-1512), who was concerned about the dispersal of records of gagaku and other arts during the Onin War."
"This is a compilation of records by Tsuaki To, a member of the Raku-ya, detailing gagaku and bugaku with the sho at its center, making it a valuable record of ancient Japanese music."
"The ritual music that was transmitted from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century is the basis."
"In China, ya-yüe refers to music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the musical pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on the music that was performed at Banquets of the Tang Dynasty."
"In the category of music, there are various international names such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Linyi music (music of Champa), reflecting the diverse influences. It also includes elements of traditional Japanese music that date back before the introduction of music from the continent."
"Before modern times, the Tenshokaku at Shitenno-ji Temple in Osaka, the Gakusho at the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, and the Nanto Gakusho at Kasuga Grand Shrine in Nara were considered the three major Gakusho."
"These music schools were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the foundation of the current music department of the Imperial Household Agency, and the traditions of each music school are continued in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences have been observed between folk songs and declarations, creating a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 songs have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of a traditional S-country song and dance.
There is a view that only those items brought from outside Japan are considered as Gagaku.
"Left-way dance and Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Linyi (South Vietnam) origins."
"Right dance, Goryeo music ...... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) type"
These include songs produced in Japan that imitate the above style (Japanese music).
A song (yōmu うたいもの) created in the Heian period.
Refer to the lyrics for the song.
There are cases in which 歌風歌舞 and 謡物 are collectively referred to as ancient songs and ballads.
Emperor Kanmu (737–806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born in the 9th year of Tenpyo era (737) as the first son of Emperor Shirakabe (later known as Emperor Kōnin).
"According to the Chronicles of Japan, the mother Takano Shinkasa is a descendant of the Baekje royal family, whose ancestor is King Munheung of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince YasuDoko (later Emperor Heijō) and Prince Kami (later Emperor Saga), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Ōtomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Emperor Hakukabe, ascended the throne, Prince Daishi was not desired as the crown prince because his mother, Takano Shinyoka, belonged to the low-class immigrant Yamashiro clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat and served in various positions such as Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Vice Minister of the Center."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan and others, the former Crown Prince, Prince Motoi, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed, and Prince Shotoku was proclaimed Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"The influence of the various temples of Nara Buddhism in Heijokyo (Nara) was disliked, so the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was constructed, and in 794, Heian-kyo was newly built."
"Once again, a military force led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro was sent to invade the Tohoku region and bring the Ezo people under control."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing hardship to the peasants with such military and architectural works."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new developments to Japanese Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Kanmu.
"Princess Inoue and Prince Tage suffered unnatural deaths, and at the beginning of his reign, his younger brother Prince Sakura was exiled for the assassination of Fujiwara Tane-tsuguyo in 785 and died in confinement, showing a dark side as well."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on the 19th of July in the 19th year of Enryaku (800), Emperor Saga honored Prince Sawara as Emperor Suiko, designated Princess Inoue's grave as a mausoleum, and restored the position of empress."
"While known as the protector of Saicho and Kukai, existing Buddhist sects exerted pressure on the so-called ""Nanto Rokushu"" by seizing their land and oppressing them due to their excessive influence in the government."
"It has also been said that the disorder in the inner palace led to the later ""Murders at the Palace of Sui"" and became a breeding ground for it."
"He passed away on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of Enryaku."
"Emperor Jimmu, ancestor of the Japanese Empire, was given the posthumous name ""Yamato Takeru Ikazuchi Iyatsukari no Miko."""
"Along with this, Emperor Kammu was given the posthumous title in Chinese style."
"Kashiwabara was also known as Emperor Kashiwabara, or Emperor Kashiharada Mikado Tamegomi no Mikoto."
"The grave is considered to be Kashihara-no-Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he was adamant about wanting to be buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he ended up at the Kasahara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
"In the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at the Heian Shrine."
"Furthermore, all Emperors are enshrined in one of the three Imperial sanctuaries in the Imperial Palace, the Koreiden."
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, which is a traditional press conference, Akihito made a comment concerning the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea, as the Chronicle of Japan mentions that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was a descendant of King Musin of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was heavily reported in the South Korean media and became a hot topic."
"In some circles, there have been reports that suggest a significant leap in logic, asserting that the imperial family has Korean origins, known as the theory of the ancient Korean kingdom of Baekje."
"The Otani family (Ootanike) is a surname of the descendants of Soka, the son of Kakue of Kakuginijishino and Hironaga Hino."
"Hino Hiroyuki is a minor aristocrat from Kyoto, while Kakunin is the daughter of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu school of Pure Land Buddhism, who inherited the position of head priest at Honganji, the main temple of the school."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, both the head of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect (Nishi Honganji) and the head of the Shinshu Otani sect (Shinshu Honbyo) separated in 1602 and adopted their surnames."
"The origin of the Ohtani family name is due to the establishment of the grave of Shinran mentioned later at the Ohtani site at the northern gate of the Honen-in Temple in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Honanji was counted as one of the feudal lords in the Warring States period (Japan) due to the influence it had as a force aligning with the Ikko Ikki movement. Although it is often referred to with the title ""Honanji"" attached to the Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) or given name of the head priest, such as ""Honanji Kennyo"" or ""Honanji Koso"", this is purely a convenience in terms of address. The lineage of the Honanji head priests did not make Honanji their family name or surname, nor did the existence of a clan called the Honanji clan."
"Kakushinji witnessed Shinran's passing in 1262 and in 1272, he built a hall to enshrine his remains in O-tani near his home in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Daioji Temple became a place of worship for Jodo Shinshu followers as Shinran's mausoleum, and it was decided that Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushinni, would oversee its management as the custodian."
"However, the Otani mausoleum ended up in a dispute over the stewardship between Kakuei's son Kakujo and his half-brother Yoshizen, as it gathered pilgrimages and donations from disciples from across the country. Kakujo narrowly emerged victorious and established the hereditary stewardship of the mausoleum within his own family lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Daishi Honganji Temple."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited the Hongan-ji temple, furthering the formation of the sect. During the time of the 5th generation Jakujo in the Muromachi period, they expanded to the Hokuriku region and by the era of the 7th generation Zonjo, the Hongan-ji sect had formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a sect since after Shinran's death, the formation of the sect has been significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a branch temple of Seiun-in, and it is said that the Honganji family, through its relationship with the Hino family (Shinran's original family), also took on roles similar to the stewards of the Kujō family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, due to the activities of the 8th Monshu, Rennyo, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan, but in 1465, the main temple in Ōtani was destroyed and the Monshu moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, then to the Yamanaka district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"Against the background of the expansion of the teaching trends in the Jodo sect during the time of Rennyo, the Ikko Ikki uprising occurred in Kaga in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Hashiba family by the Kaga Honganji religious group, resulting in the emergence of a situation known as a ""country governed by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect gained strength and began to actively expand its activities throughout Japan, from small farmers to samurai and provincial lords, using its organizational power as a weapon. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered war damage in the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532, and the 10th head, Shōnyo, moved to the Ishiyama Gobō founded by Rennyo in Nishinaru-gun, Settsu Province (now Osaka City), renaming it Ishiyama Honganji."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the top of a hill on the northern edge of the Kamitown Plateau.
It controlled the key river traffic point in Osaka at the mouth of the Yodogawa River.
"Using the Echizen Province as its base, Shonin Shonyo sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, thus securing the power base of the Honganji temple."
"On the other hand, from the late Edo period, in local Jodo Shinshu sects like those in Hokuriku, some began to stray from the control of Honshuji and follow their own path."
"During the time of Kenji no Ko, the 11th head of the Shoko lineage, the Honganji sect, which had gained significant independence, ventured into the Kinai region and clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by confiscating territorial power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the Honganji Temple fortified at Ishiyama along with Konyo and other temple followers throughout various regions mounting a resistance against the Oda clan. As a result of this collaboration, the Honganji Temple gained the upper hand and greatly troubled Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjo-ji Temple in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ishikawa clan, who had recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan, was annihilated. Resistance in various regions was weakening, and in 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Hongan-ji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizugawa. The Hongan-ji Temple suffered successive defeats outside its own territory."
"While Honganji Temple continued to gather support from the Iga clan and others, it gradually became isolated among enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to leave Ishiyama Honganji. Thus, the power of Honganji Temple as a feudal lord ceased to exist."
"At that time, the eldest son Noriyoshi, who continued to resist the intentions of Kenjo, disagreed with him. When Kenjo passed away in 1593, his third son Junjo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, amid the dispute over the position of the temple's head, Hongan-ji began to split, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu gave Kennyo's son-in-law, Kyonyo, a separate temple ground, splitting East Hongan-ji from the original Hongan-ji."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishihon Ganji Temple, to Kyonyo's sect at Higashi Honganji Temple, causing Honganji Temple to split into east and west."
"Shinran, originally the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the head of both the Eastern and Western Tani families, who trace their lineage back to Hino Hirotuna (the father of Kakunyo), have a tradition of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles from generation to generation. Additionally, they have continued to intermarry with court nobles, leading to the further advancement of their nobility through their mothers' lineage."
Kyo-tanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo Tanabe City is located in the central part of the triangular area of three prefectures, Kyoto, in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, adjoining Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture."
"The Kizugawa River flows north-south on the east side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), sandwiched between the Nara mountain range on the west side, with the central area traversed by the West Japan Railway Company's Sagano Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City have a strong commuter town character."
"On April 1, 1997, Tanabe Town in Tsukiko District became a city."
"The city of Kyoto Prefecture, which was the 12th city to be established in Japan in 20 years since the city of Yawata, and the 669th city in the country, was born."
"In order to avoid overlapping with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture at the time, Kyoto Prefecture added ""Kyoto"" to create ""Kyotanabe City"" for Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, which was then designated as a city, and a name change was also implemented on the same day to change ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City""."
The new city name was selected from a general public offering.

"The statue of the Zen master, Ikkyu Sojun, and the famous garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties."
"In the city, there are Kintetsu Nittenba Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyamashite Station as representative stations."
"Kintetsu Shindenbashi Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the central stations in Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station in the Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, regular commuter trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run all the way to Kintetsu Shin-Osaka Station."
"JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station, and it was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city was officially established."
This is a similar case to the Nishimuko Station and Higashimuko Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line), and it is speculated that the use of the former province name ""Kii"" in the station name in Tanabe City is to avoid duplication of station names within the West Japan Railway Company's jurisdiction."

"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in the current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is a governor, a province, and a distant province."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in the year 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was built on land spanning two districts: Katsuragino District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the present-day central area of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It was a planned city in the shape of a rectangle, measuring 4.5 km from east to west and 5.2 km from north to south."
"Establish the Imperial Palace at the northern edge of the capital city, and then place the Suzaku Avenue from the center of the city, with the left side being the Left Capital and the right side being the Right Capital (the east side is the Left Capital and the west side is the Right Capital)."
"The layout plan basically follows Heijokyo, with elements imitating the layout of Chang'an during the Sui and Tang dynasties."
"However, there were no walls."
"There is a theory that the selection of this land was based on the concept of Four Gods Corresponding to Four Directions in feng shui, which was introduced from China."
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northernmost main street is Ichijo Street, located between Imadegawa Street and Marutacho Street in the present day."
"The southern end of Kujo Oji Avenue corresponds to Kujo-dori, slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station."
The Tokyo Ongonʼs Tokyo Kyokudai Road corresponds to the current Teramachi Street.
The estimated location on the western end of Saiin Saiogawa-ohji in the West Kyoto Ward is a line connecting the JR West San'in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Railway Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Saiin Station in the north-south direction.
"Within the capital city, the area was divided into ""towns"" of 40 lengths (approximately 120 meters) square, bound by main roads and side streets running in the cardinal directions."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the north side) is called ""jo"" and a collection of four rows in the north-south direction is called ""bo."""
Each of the 16 towns belonging to the same ward was assigned a number.
"As a result, each town came to be called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juuyon Cho""."
"Even small roads had a width of 4 yards (approximately 12m), while major roads had a width of 8 yards (approximately 24m) or more."
The existing roads in Kyoto city are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the Avenue of Suzaku, the width reached 28 jo (about 84 meters)."
"Additionally, parallel rivers (Horikawa River, Nishihorikawa River) flowed through Horikawa Koji and Nishihorikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu established the capital city of Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that had supported the government of the Emperor Tenmu lineage in Yamato Province and establish a new capital for the Emperor Tenchi lineage.
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents that began with the assassination of Fujiwara Tane-tsuguhayo at Nagaoka-kyo and culminated in the dismissal of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyo."
It is believed that the construction of Heian-kyo started with the construction of the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (market town).
"Most of the land in the Kyo-ku region is part of the wetlands formed by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), so urbanization did not progress even by the 9th century."
"By the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become ineffective, there were cases of land being converted into agricultural land, even though this was originally prohibited within the capital."
"The residential area for nobles was established in the left capital province except for the northern part of the right capital, near the Daini Palace."
"Nihon Kokki was a chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, and it is the third in the series of six national histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840) in Japan, it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara Shoshi and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Kōnin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Fumitsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Due to the deaths of three individuals before the matter could be resolved, Emperor Junna later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Naoyuki Ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono No Mimori, Sakanoue no Imiki, and Shimada Seida to continue the task."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, further orders were issued to Fujiwara Tsugunari, Minamoto Tsunemasa, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Kakutari."
"Furthermore, it was reported that Furu Takaya Niwa and Yamada Furitsugu had joined, and on December 9th of the 7th year of the Jōwa era (841), the work was finally completed."
"The compilation took a total of 21 years, and the only person who was involved in the project for three generations of emperors was Fujiwara no Motozane."
"Following the Nihon Shoki, this continues with the reigns of Emperor Kōhō, Empress Kōken, and Emperor Junna during the rule of Emperor Kammu."
"In the early 15th century, there were 40 volumes available. However, they were later dispersed. It was not until Hayashi Ohikoichi's student, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a copy of 10 volumes in the Sanjo Nishike estate (there is an alternative theory that it was edited by Yoshimitsu Yanagihara), that it was first published."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, and there is no volume at all during the reign of Emperor Junna."
"It can restore the text to some extent from the excerpt version of ""Nihon Kiryaku"" such as the Six National Histories, and the classification of entries in the Six National Histories called ""Ruiju Kokushi."""
"Collected excerpts from various works include ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Koki Itsu Bun"", based on which publications like Shueisha Translation Notes on Japanese Historical Materials and Kodansha Academic Library have been released."
It is said that the opinions of Fujiwara no Noritoshi are most reflected in the content.
"Adding brief biographies (obituaries) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials follows the example of the ""Chronicles of Japan,"" and is the same as other subsequent historical books."
"However, the obituary in this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticism and impressions. In the Six National Histories, it is unique as it maintains a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkoku-shi included a larger number of waka poems compared to earlier and later historical documents.
Sei Shonagon (966 – 1025) was a female writer and poet during the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is not confirmed."
"One of the ""Five Men of Pear Jars,"" she was the renowned poetess and daughter of the late years of the poet Kiyo Hara Mototosuke (908-990)."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother as ""Higaki-no-Ona"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a nonsensical theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some sources say great-grandfather) is the renowned poet Kiyohara no Motosuke, represents the Kokin Wakashu."
"There are women married to my brothers, Yagura no Kami Tamenari, Dazai-shoko no Kami Chishu, Konoe Gon no Kamifyoshiku, and Fujiwara no Tsunayo's brother, Fujiwara no Narimi."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is the name of a concubine, ""Sei"" is taken from the family name of Seiwa, and ""Shonagon"" is said to be taken from a relative's official position."
"The real name is unknown, though there is a theory that it was ""Nagiko"" (from ""Makura no Soshi Shou""), which is not reliable enough to believe."
"Considered one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, she is linked to the anthology ""Kiyoshanagonshu,"" containing 42 poems (although some versions have 31 poems)."
"In the ""Koshigoi Waka-shu"" following, fourteen are included in the official collection."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"The father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate."
"The mother is Princess Keijuin, daughter of Prince Norimichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is a paternal half-brother."
"At first he was a monk, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other shogunate vassals."
"Supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino province, he goes up to the capital and becomes the 15th shogun."
"As he eventually came into conflict with Nobunaga, he joined forces with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to encircle him with a network of alliances."
"Although Oda Nobunaga was initially cornered, he was eventually expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi Shogunate was effectively destroyed."
"After that, he spent his remaining years with the support of Motonari Mōri, and then Nobunaga Oda received assistance from Hideyoshi Toyotomi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Due to the fact that Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the adopted child of his older brother, he became a disciple of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Shingū, at a young age and entered the Buddhist temple of Kōfuku-ji Ichijō-in, taking on the name Kakkei."
"Later, he was promoted to the position of Gonsosozu at Kofukuji Temple."
"In the Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th Shogun, my older brother Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide, the Sanmi-no-Sanmi, and others. I, Ashikaga Kushiin-in-shuusuke, the younger brother and head priest of Kakuon-ji, was also lured into assassination."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple (Hisahide was afraid of turning Kofukuji Temple into an enemy by killing Yoshiaki, as he was the brother of the shogun and promised to become the head priest of the temple in the future, so he kept him imprisoned)."
"However, with the help of vassals Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Koremasa, he managed to escape and on February 17th of the 9th year of Eiroku (1566), he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshitoki."
"In the book that describes Yoshiaki, it is recorded that he was also called the warrior family residence, among other names."
"When banished from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was known as the ""Poor Regent."""
"On April 21st, he was secretly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and appointed as Left Buto."
"There are some doubts about the timing of the appointment, but according to Yasumune Yamashina's ""Yasumune Kyo-ki"", it is clear that he had already been appointed before February of the 11th year of the Eiroku era (1568) when he received a recommendation for promotion to Jushi-i from an emissary of Oda Nobunaga who appeared at his residence on the day he received his appointment as shogun."
"After escaping from Kyoto, Yoshiaki first sought refuge with the father and son Oda Nobunaga and Oda Nobutomo in Omi Province. However, because Nobutomo secretly colluded with the Three Miyoshi Amigos, in August he fled to the domain of his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshimune in Wakasa Province."
"As among the Wakasa Takeda clan there were disputes over the succession and power struggles among senior vassals, they lacked the strength to come to Kyoto, and in September they fled to the Asakura Yoshikage of Echizen province and requested support for the restoration of the shogunate."
"However, Yoshimichi Asakura already had the ""Kuruma Valley Palace"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and as he did not have the intention to actively go to the capital with Yoshizuki Ashikaga, who had just returned to secular life, the plan to go to the capital was not realized."
"The position of kamban is held by Yoshikage Asakura. (Incidentally, there is no documentary evidence up to this point that Yoshitaka had performed the formal ceremony of entering manhood and we can say that his coming-of-age ceremony was surprisingly delayed for the time)."
"Eventually, through the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura clan, Ieyasu fled to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was enthroned by Oda Nobunaga and arrived in Kyoto."
"On October 18, he received the appointment of Shogun from the Imperial Court and assumed the position of the 15th Shogun."
He was promoted to Jūshichi-i (Junior Fourth Rank) concurrently with being appointed as Sangi and Left Guard Captain.
JR Kyoto Line is the colloquial name for the stretch between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the Tokaido Main Line operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"The nickname ""JR"" is added to avoid confusion because the Keihan Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, which both connect at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and because it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is applied directly as the line color."
"The Yodogawa River runs parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line, connecting Kyoto and Osaka in just 28 minutes with a distance of 42.8km (maximum speed is 130km/h)."
"It is a double-track line with double tracks in both directions (outer track, inner track) for the entire section."
"You can use J SURF ICOCA at all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, as well as Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operating management system is implemented throughout the line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"In addition to direct rapid, rapid, and local trains on the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line (Keihan Honsen Line), special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, the San'in region, and other destinations."
"Additionally, nearly half of the local trains operate to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR conversion, sleeper express trains bound for Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains bound for the Nanki area starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train service to the Sanin region that started operations with the opening of the Chizu Express, now started operating through to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section dramatically increased."
"Haruka, which started operating simultaneously with the opening of Kansai Airport, began operating all trains to Kyoto on a regular basis one year later. The route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains, including the Thunderbird Limited Express for the Hokuriku region, and other trains."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains departing and arriving in Kyoto for Kyushu were completely abolished in the timetable revision of March 15, 2008."
"From Shin-Osaka, the express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" heading down the Osaka Loop Line enter the Sankawa Line from Ibaraki Station (Departure 3), enter the freight line, and then enter Shin-Osaka via the Suita signal station."
"As a result, it may take slightly longer on limited express and rapid express trains running on the outer lines of the same section, and depending on the time of day, there may be cases where two limited express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The track alignment on almost the entire line from Kyoto to Osaka is extremely good, and speeds of up to 130 km/h are possible on the outer tracks except for some curved sections."
"The inner line is also designed for speeds of up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner line (except for transfer and special trains)."
The express trains running on this section are as follows.
"In addition, there are transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze"" and ""Tanba"" trains, as well as ""Hokkeinki"" trains that run on this section in relation to the inbound and outbound of Mukohachi (Kyoto Integrated Operation Center)."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukoujimacho and Osaka on the ""Thunderbird""-""Raicho""-""Kitaguni"" line travels via the Kitakata freight line."
"When storing the Osaka-bound train at the Kyoto Integrated Operations Office, proceed in the direction towards Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the northbound freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route when departing)."
"Therefore, if you are running in and out of the warehouse, the front and back of the formation are reversed."
"Shin-kaisoku runs directly from JR Kobe Line and Sanyo Main Line Amagasaki, Kamigori, Ako Line Ako direction through JR Kyoto Line to Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station, and Tsuruga."
"Between daytime and evening, trains run every 15 minutes. One out of four trains heading towards Kyoto during the day goes to the Kosai Line, while the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four of them through the Biwako Line at night.
"Operated using the JR West 223 series trainsets 1000 and 2000 series, with 8 or 12 cars in the formation."
The Kyoto Jukan Expressway is a high-standard main road (National Route 478) that runs approximately 100km from Kyoto's Kuse District Kum
"It runs vertically through the long north-south Kyoto Prefecture, enhancing collaboration between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region, and serving as the vulnerable southern outer ring road of the Kyoto metropolitan area with high-standard road network."
"The governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""spine of Kyoto""."
"Currently, three sections, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, with the starting point side named the Kyoshin Bypass instead of the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"Also, the Kyoto Tamba Highway is often referred to as the Kyoto Vertical Highway in general."
"The main line section on the Amanohashidate IC side in Miyazu will not be the final point here, and it is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high standard road."
"Please note that the section from Kuyamazai IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed expressway, so the minimum speed applies and passing by small vehicles is not possible."
"As a result, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Line tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to drive only on the toll-free section."
"The Kyo-Tamba Wachi IC-Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open in the summer to fall of 2008, is scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. at that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC-Ayabe JCT will also be under the management of the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, therefore, the current toll-free section of Ayabe Ankokuji IC-Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to become a toll road."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamotosen Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji Toll Plaza will be newly established."
"As a result, the Aya Miyazu Road no longer has toll booths on the main line."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto toll booth (Ayabe JCT) has a design that is close to temporary prefabricated.
"The project from Tanba IC to Kyoto Tanba Wachi IC is currently being carried out by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, and is scheduled to open in the fiscal year 2014. However, the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: General National Route 9 Otonon-saka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC～Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, while General National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC～Chiyogawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: Tatagari IC ~ Chiyokawa IC changed from National Route 9 to General National Highway 478."
"September 9, 1993: Opening of the Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC as a general toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to Maizuru-Oe Interchange via Ayabe Junction with the opening of the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (temporary two lanes, opposite direction)."
"October 1, 2005: Privatization of the four government corporations related to roads transferred ownership to the Japan Highway Public Corporation for High-speed Roads Ownership and Debt Repayment Organization, and management to the West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections indicated by the ■ background color in the IC number field indicate that the road has already been opened for use.
"Furthermore, the parts where the background color of the facility name column is ☐ indicate that the facility is not in use or completed."
The name of the section that is not open yet is temporary.

"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with an altitude of 848m encompassing the entire Mount Hiei."
"The name Enryaku-ji is more commonly referred to as Mount Hiei, and often simply as Hiei."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also known as Hokurei.
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, opened by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (chief priest) is called a Tendai Zasu and oversees the sub-temples.
"Since the founding of Kukai, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism, along with Mount Koya's Kongo-ji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (Zhi Guan), and nenbutsu were also practiced, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university, gaining the respect of the imperial family and nobility in the Heian period and wielding significant power."
"Especially, the blessings and prayers conducted through Esoteric Buddhism garnered the support of the aristocracy in the Heian period, with the esoteric practices of Enryaku-ji temple being referred to as ""Daimitsu"" in contrast to the Esoteric Buddhism of the Tendai sect's To-ji temple."
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the east tower (toudou), west tower (saitou), yokogawa (yokawa), etc., scattered in the precinct from the mountaintop of Mt. Hie to the east foot, consisting of three towers and sixteen valleys."
"In the 7th year of the Enryaku era (788), Saicho founded a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, marking the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" was granted by taking the era name at the time of establishment, which was in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced many famous monks who laid the foundation of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, such as Ennin, Enchin, the founder of Yūzū-nembutsu Ryōnin, the founder of Jōdo-shu Hōnen, the founder of Jōdo Shinshu Shinran, the founder of Rinzai Zen Eisai, the founder of Sōtō Zen Dōgen, and the founder of Nichiren Nichiren. Many founders of new Buddhist sects and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have practiced on Mount Hiei when they were young, which is why it is also known as the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism""."
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"Furthermore, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year mountain pilgrimage"" and the ""1000-day circling of peaks"" have been continued to the present day, making it a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and registered as a world cultural heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki,"" and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the foot of the eastern slope, Oyamazumi-no-kami, the landowner of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's lay name was Mitsunoo Hitoshirano, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo-Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga District, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767.)"
"At the age of 15, in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained (took up religious orders) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Mii-dera Temple in Ōmi province, and assumed the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the 4th year of Enryaku (785), I received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became an official monk."
"A young Masumi decided to dedicate himself to training and studying scriptures on Mount Hiei near his hometown, instead of seeking a stable position in a large temple in Nara."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the greatest among many scriptures, and he studied the ""Three Great Sections of the Lotus Sutra"" written by the Chinese Tiantai master Zhiyi (Chigi) (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Mahāyāna Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788 AD), Saicho built a small temple consisting of Yakushi Hall, Monju Hall, and a Scripture Repository at the current location of the main hall, naming it Ichijo Shikanin."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Enryaku era (824 AD)."
"During the time of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho received the Emperor's and the Waki family's support, and as a result, the Mount Hiei Temple began to prosper as a dojo for national protection in Kyoto’s inauspicious direction (northeast)."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a return student (short-term overseas research student)."
"In the year Enryaku 23 (804 AD), he crossed to Tang on a ship as a envoy."
"Saicho visited the sacred site of Mt. Hiei, and learned Tendai teachings from Docho Zenji, a direct disciple of the Tendai master Zhiyi, as well as the Mahayana Bodhisattva Precepts. He also studied Tendai teachings from Gyojo, the abbot of Hongyaku-san."
"Furthermore, at the Ryukoji Temple in Echizen (Shaoxing), they are learning esoteric Buddhism from Shunkyo Ajari, and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is commonly believed that God rules the night by deifying the moon, but there are also alternative theories (see below)."
The reading of the name can also be Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Kojiki of Yasakatome killing the Ho-ichi, so although generally considered a male deity, there is no description in the Kojiki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon deity is often depicted as a goddess, and many other myths from different countries also feature warlike goddesses with aggressive personalities. Therefore, some scholars argue for the theory that the deity in the story of Yasoshima no Kami's murder must be a goddess, as it cannot be definitively determined as a male deity."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi was said to have been born from his right eye while performing purification after escaping from Yomi. He, along with Amaterasu born from his other eye, and Susanoo born from his nose, make up the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki,"" there is a story that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and there is also a story that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, and the dominion is not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born in opposition to Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as documented in the ""Book of Historical Events""), it is said that after Pangu's death, his left eye turned into the sun and his right eye turned into the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was only in later times that the two became identified with each other."
"In addition, in the Genesis of the Old Testament, on the fourth day of the creation of heaven and earth, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and the night respectively, and to separate light from darkness. This is the creation of the sun and moon spoken of in the story."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also thought to follow the common pattern of a worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and the moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susano'o, but he does not appear much in the mythologies of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in significant deeds."
"It is only briefly mentioned in book five, in a short passage, where the origins of grain are discussed."
There is a theory that balance is maintained by placing a non-interfering god between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susano'o.
"A similar structure can also be seen in the relationship between Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, as well as between Hoori and Hoderi with Hosuseri."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some believe in the theory of the same god, as their dominions and episodes partly overlap."
"In the first volume of the ""Kojiki,"" he was born when the right eye of Izanagi-no-mikoto was washed, and he is called one of the ""Three Precious Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susano-o."
"Tsukuyomi was ordered to ""inform about the land of night eating,"" but he has not been active since then."
There is also a theory that there is a country of the night where the god Izanami is located.
"In the fifth section of the Age of the Gods in the Nihon Shoki, it is briefly described that ""a god was born who radiated light second only to the sun, and sent to the heavens to be a ruling presence alongside the sun."" However, in the following first volume, there is a variant account that mentions Izanagi no Mikoto giving birth to Ohiruome no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and giving birth to Tsukuyomi no Mikoto holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"Regarding the domain of dominion, there are several stories in which it is commanded to rule the heavens along with the Great Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, on one hand, and a story in which it is instructed to ""control the eight-hundred layers of the tides of the Cang Haiyuan"" (this seems to have come from the concept that the moon controls the tides), multiple stories of the birth of three gods are parallel to each other."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is mentioned that Amaterasu-Omikami and Tsukuyomi were ordered to govern the heavens together, but later Tsukuyomi was instructed to descend and meet the god Uke Mochi in the celestial realm."
"In response, the Food Guardian spat out rice as an offering, but Takitsumeminosuke became angry, calling it ""disgusting,"" and ended up killing the Food Guardian with a sword."
"From the body of the food-giving God, cows, horses, silkworms, rice, etc. were born, and this became the origin of crops."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasamusho under the Ritsuryo system in ancient Japan."
"It refers to the person with knowledge of Yin Yang Tao based on the concepts of Yin Yang Five Elements who is in charge of divination, geomancy, and other techniques, and later expanded to oversee divination, sorcery, and various rituals beyond the original regulations of the Ritsuryo system."
"Since the Middle Ages, it has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who personally practice divination, sorcery, and rituals in various places, and today it is defined as a type of clergy who conduct private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"Sometimes pronounced ""onyoji"" without the repeat-voicing."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin Yang and the Five Elements in ancient China, starting from the Xia dynasty to the Yin and Zhou dynasties, almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. This theory is closely related to astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, and was transmitted directly from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) to Japan by the Asuka period, at the latest by 512 AD when scholars of the Five Classics arrived, and by 554 AD when a divination scholar came (in the reigns of Emperor Keitai and Emperor Kimmu, respectively)."
"Although initially the impact of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, in 602 AD (Emperor Suiko 10), Ganjin, who can be considered as a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, arrived from Baekje. He taught various studies to 34 selected bureaucrats, including Prince Shōtoku, which eventually had a great influence on the country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Ganreki) was adopted as an official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, envoys were dispatched to Sui, a advanced civilization, in 607 (15th year of Empress Suiko). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen Article Constitution and the Twelve Ranks of Cap and Robe system."
"After that, the imperial court continued to send students to China with the sending of envoys to the Sui dynasty (later to the Tang dynasty), and also invited many monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula to the Chinese mainland or ports, striving for further knowledge absorption."
"With the advance of various studies, it became increasingly important in Japan to consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and to predict the future and obtain guidance for various matters by judging fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the interplay of the five elements in the Yin-Yang theory. As a strategy to determine good and bad luck and establish a code of conduct, the Yin-Yang and five elements theory came to be emphasized."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomy and Divination who took a divining rod during the Jinshin War, which had deep knowledge of yin-yang and five elements philosophy, established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (Emperor Tenmu 4th year)."
"In the year 685 (13th year of Emperor Tenmu), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Onmyo Gogyo philosophy became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasasho was formally recognized, and it was stipulated that permanent officials such as astronomers, Onmyoji, calendar scientists, and leakage-cutter scientists would be stationed there. Alongside the official appointment of priests for divination in the Jingikan, they would now also be responsible for conducting public divination ceremonies."
"Those responsible for introducing technologies from the continent are often scholars and onmyoji who are well-versed in various disciplines and skilled in reading Chinese texts. They are generally individuals who have come from the Chinese mainland, previously dominated by the Han and Later Han dynasties, as well as the Sui dynasty that succeeded them, Goguryeo and Baekje, who held power on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholar monks who originally came from Silla, which had influence on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (during the reign of Emperor Tenji), in which Japan sent reinforcements to its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula after the downfall of the Baekje dynasty. During this time, many scholars from Baekje fled as refugees and a significant number of them were appointed to official positions."
"In the early days of the establishment of the Onmyoji, their main skills were purely divination, feng shui (similar to what is now called ""geomancy""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and management of time. They mainly made predictions based on theoretical analysis grounded in the principles of Yin Yang and the Five Elements regarding astronomical observation, calendar management, and the auspiciousness of events. They did not perform any religious rituals or sorcery like Shinto priests or monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court and in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events like the relocation of the capital."
