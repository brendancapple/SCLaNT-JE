The Doshisha is a school corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha is a comprehensive educational institution founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima, based on the Christian Protestant (Congregationalist) faith. It comprises nine educational institutions, from university to kindergarten, all bearing the name ""Doshisha"" (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 students are studying at Doshisha."
"Currently, Doshisha University is rated <AA+> by Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating out of 21.
"It is among the top educational corporations, alongside Waseda University and Keio University."
"Doshisha's founding spirit is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Josiah Conder envisioned the cultivation of individuals who could ""apply their conscience to their skills"" as the purpose of his educational institution."
"It was our hope that by pursuing ""moral education"" based on Christianity alongside knowledge education, we could nurture individuals whose lives are filled with ""conscience,"" ensuring they are not solely focused on intellectual pursuits."
"Monuments bearing his words, inscribed in his own handwriting, stand at Doshisha University and other institutions."
"This monument of conscience bears the inscription, ""May there arise men of strong character, whose conscience fills their whole being."""
"Furthermore, the educational philosophy of ""Christianism,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" are proposed as concrete means to realize this ""conscience"" education, aiming to cultivate individuals who embody the ""conscience of the nation."""
"A Christian Protestant school corporation, descended from the Congregationalist tradition."
"However, it differs in nature from what are known as mission-oriented universities, and does not have Christian evangelism as its primary purpose (it does not use education as a means of evangelism)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."

"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"The diary of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Higashibōjō Kazunaga Kyōki,"" entry for August 1st, Meio 3 (1494), states: ""Secret tradition says that Ikkyū Zenji was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and took the aliases Kuangyunzi, Kacu-ro, and Mukei."
"The Buddhist name is Soshu, also written as Sosun."
Ikkū is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At the age of six, he entered the Zōgai-shūkan of Ankoku-ji Temple in Kyoto and received the precepts, being named Shūken."
"He showed exceptional poetic talent at an early age, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at 15 gained renown and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and took the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively stated whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodon, at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (the 22nd year of the Oei era)."
"Iku received the Dharma name Ikkyū from Haku-sō after answering the koan ""Dōzan's Three Meals of Sticks"" with the words, ""From the world of existence to the world of non-existence, returning, a moment's rest. If it rains, let it rain; if it blows, let it blow."""
"""Aroji"" (有漏路) refers to the world of delusion (煩悩), while ""Muroji"" (無漏路) refers to the world of enlightenment (仏)."
"One night in 1420, he suddenly attained enlightenment upon hearing the cawing of a crow."
"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"They sent Huasou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verse, calligraphy, and painting, marked by eccentricity."
"In 1428, Emperor Shoko died without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū recommended Emperor Go-Hachijo for the throne.
"From the ""Chronological Biography of Ikkyū Sōjun, the Zen Master of the East Sea."""
"However, Shukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was due to the Shogunate's approval, and that Ikkyū's recommendation played no role."
"In 1474, six years after the Ōnin War, he was appointed the 47th abbot of Daitoku-ji Temple by Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado's imperial decree. Though he did not reside at the temple, he devoted himself to its restoration."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace located in Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"The Imperial Palace in Tokyo (former Edo Castle) was preserved in 1877, following the Emperor's move to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also called Kyoto Imperial Palace after the Meiji era.
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyō, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but due to war and other disasters, it fell into disrepair and the Imperial Court moved to the Satō-no-uchi Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the Sato Inner Palaces, and it was the residence of the emperors of the Jimyoin line, who later became known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji line, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō Tomikoji Inner Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the exact same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expansion based on it."
"Normally, attendance requires application, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
Kyoto Imperial Palace was the residence and office of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present day (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace, and Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, which surrounds them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not as high as those of foreign castles, some argue that this reflects a difference in the level of familiarity between the common people and their rulers (the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that there has never been an incident in Japan similar to the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch (king) during the French Revolution, is one of the bases for this consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection, near the JR West Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the inner palaces, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian architectural style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto, having moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo only a decade earlier, he lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair. He ordered that the palace be preserved and its former appearance maintained."
"The main buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegotem, Koshun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Seiden Palace of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijōsai would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Moreover, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, such as Kyoto. In 1990, for the enthronement of the current Emperor, the ceremony was held for the first time in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor where he sits during his enthronement, symbolizing his accession, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the enthronement ceremony of the current Emperor, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with a plain wooden frame, gable roof, and cypress bark shingles, with a span of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special occasions, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two earthen walls have five horizontal lines, a mark of the highest status for a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon, the Shishinden lies directly ahead."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency, the term refers to all music performed by the Department of Music, excluding Western music."
Much of it is inherited as court music in the form of instrumental pieces.
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world still performed in large ensembles.
"However, as a traditional ensemble form, Gagaku was discontinued for over a century after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate gathered descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been preserved."
"It is speculated that the notation of the hichiriki score, written in katakana, is sung as a ""shōga"" (a method of memorizing melodies by singing the musical notation), faithfully preserving the pronunciation characteristics of the Japanese language before the 16th century, including the pronunciation of the ""h"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo,"" and so on."
"Many similarities exist between the notation used in the 楽琵琶 score and the pipa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, suggesting a strong inheritance from older continental styles."
"The most important historical document is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tōshū (1450-1512) who lamented the loss of records of gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and other arts due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū of the Shōgakka family compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku, primarily focused on the shō, providing valuable documentation of ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ritual music that originated in China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China and is currently performed in Japanese gagaku, is believed to be based on the music of the Tang dynasty's Yanle, which was played at banquets."
"The categories of music, including Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music), reflect a rich international character, and elements of ancient Japanese music predating the introduction of music from the continent are also present."
"Before the modern era, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennoji Temple (Osaka), the Dai-uchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha (Nara) were considered the three major musical institutions."
"These musical institutions, known as ""gakusho"" in modern times, were brought to Tokyo and became the foundation of the present-day Imperial Household Agency's music department. However, the traditions of each individual gakusho continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are inherited by the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to S-country style kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only true definition of Gagaku).
"Leftward Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, Lin-yi (South Vietnamese)"
"Rightward Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China) origins."
These include songs (Honkyoku) produced in Japan that imitate the above style.
Songs created during the Heian period (Heian-era songs).
The lyrics refer to a ballad.
"Sometimes, Kokufu Kabuki and Yōkyoku are collectively referred to as ancient Japanese songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakawa (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano Shin-gasa was a descendant of the Baekje royal family, tracing her lineage back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Etsumu gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamino (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko bore Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of low-born, naturalized descent from the Wa clan. As a result, he was not expected to become crown prince and initially pursued a career as an official, serving as a Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political strife involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed. On January 2, 773, he was made Crown Prince."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"Initially, Heijo-kyo was built in 784, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built anew."
They then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Great General of Conquest to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugushi of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship these military and construction projects caused the peasants."
"He is said to have initiated the compilation of the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued"" in terms of cultural aspects."
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China, bringing new developments to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign was marked by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Todo, as well as the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, the Emperor's younger brother who had been designated Crown Prince. Prince Sawara was banished on charges of involvement in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, casting a dark shadow over the beginning of the reign."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Princess Inoue's tomb was posthumously designated as a mausoleum, and she was restored to the position of Empress."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also suppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" which had become too powerful through their involvement with the government, by confiscating their estates."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial palace was a contributing factor to the later ""Yakushi no Hen"" incident."
"Died on March 17, 806."
He was given the Japanese posthumous title Yamato-neko Amatsu-hitsugi-iya-deri-no-mikoto.
He was posthumously honored with the Chinese-style title of Emperor Kanmu.
"He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor, or Tenkoku Osse Haburi no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor."
"The tomb is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls in the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his customary press conference before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a topic of discussion in South Korean media."
"Some reports went so far as to claim that the Imperial Family is of Korean descent and to promote the ""Imperial Family Baekje Origin Theory,"" making significant leaps in logic."
"The Otani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakuei, son of Kakushinni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, who inherited the position of the head priest (Hoshū) of the Hongan-ji temple, the majority sect of Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism."
"During the Meiji era, both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Hompo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames."
"The origin of the surname Otani is attributed to the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned below, in the Otani area, north of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Although the Honganji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), wielded power comparable to that of warlords due to the spread of the Ikko-Ikki movement, and its head priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Honganji,"" such as ""Honganji Kannon"" and ""Honganji Kosuke,"" this was merely a convenient way of referring to them. The Honganji Temple head priest's lineage never adopted ""Honganji"" as their family name or surname, and there was no such thing as a ""Honganji"" clan."
"Jaku Shin Ni attended to Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in Ootani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills, in 1272."
"Ootani-do, as the mausoleum of Shinran, became a revered temple for Jodo Shinshu followers, and its management was entrusted to Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, as the caretaker."
"However, the Ootani Temple, due to the pilgrimage and donations of followers from various regions, later saw a dispute over the absentee post between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Yuizen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly won, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee post by his own lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, developed its religious organization, expanding into the Hokuriku region during the reign of the fifth abbot, Shaknyo, in the Muromachi period. By the time of the seventh abbot, Jonyo, the Hongan-ji sect had established itself in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working on establishing their own organizations since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji Temple was significantly delayed. In the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also served as stewards for the Kujo family."
"In the late 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of its 8th head priest, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji temple was destroyed, forcing the head priest to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province, and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, driving out the ruling Togashi clan and creating a situation where the Honganji sect in Kaga became known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the country was effectively ruled by the Ikkō-shū sect."
"As the 16th century dawned, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that spanned from small farmers to samurai and local lords, became increasingly active throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenmon Hokke Rebellion. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as the Ishiyama Honganji temple."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the summit of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a key point for river traffic at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Honganji, Shōnyo strengthened the temple's power base by forging close ties with various lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some members of the Honganji Buddhist sect, particularly in regions like Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central authority of the Honganji temple and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Ken'nyo, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an independent feudal power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who was advancing into the Kinai region and seeking to establish unified rule by seizing territorial power from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a decade-long conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple, led by Kannon, entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and its followers resisting Oda forces across the land, giving them the upper hand and causing significant hardship for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, among other local resistances being quelled. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a series of defeats for the Honganji Temple outside its own territory."
"Although Hongan-ji Temple continued to garner support from groups like the Saika-shu and remained strong, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to evacuate Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple. With this, Hongan-ji Temple as a territorial power ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo passed away in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point, the Honganji Temple began to split over the position of its head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site, establishing the Higashi Honganji Temple, separate from the Honganji Temple led by Kyo'nyo."
"At this time, many followers left Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, and joined Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, leading to a split in the Honganji temple."
"Both the Eastern and Western Ootani families, whose heads trace their lineage back to Shinran, originally the son of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), have a long-standing tradition of adopting sons from powerful court nobles. They also continued to intermarry with court nobles throughout generations, further solidifying their court noble status through their maternal lineage."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ide Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture. It sits at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River flowing north-south on the east side of the city and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city's center is traversed by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are heavily characterized as bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status granted, formerly Tanabe Town, Tsuzuki District."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city nationwide."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" (city establishment) with the addition of ""Kyo"" from ""Kyoto"" in the name. On the same day, the city's name was changed from ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City."""
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation is thriving, with gyokuro as a specialty product."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"Bus depot relocation on May 10, 2008."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamajiro-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Adjacent Itecho, Tsuzki District is also included in the delivery area)"
"Kannon-ji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The statue of Zen Master Ikkyū and the scenic garden are designated as Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations are Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"Furthermore, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally called Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the same time the city was incorporated.
This is a similar case to Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishimukaijima Station and Higashimukaijima Station.
"While there is a ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Line) in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the inclusion of ""Kii,"" the former province name of Wakayama, in the station name located in Tanabe City is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company jurisdiction."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot located in the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the provinces of the Ritsuryo system."
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama Prefecture, the eastern portion of Tokyo excluding the Sumida River and islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engishiki: Provincial Governor Rank Classification, Remote Province."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (延暦13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, spanned the two counties of Kadono and Atago in Yamashiro Province. It was a rectangular city, measuring 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"The Imperial Palace was established at the northernmost center of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue extending from it to the center of the city, dividing it into the Left Capital (east) and the Right Capital (west)."
"The floor plan essentially follows the Heijō-kyō model, emulating the Sui and Tang Chang'an."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols Harmony"" (Sishin Souou), derived from Feng Shui."
Heian-kyo was smaller than present-day Kyoto.
"The northernmost street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo-dori, located between the current Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
"The Ninth Avenue of the Southern Limit is currently the Kujō Street, slightly south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's main road corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of the Nishikyogoku-Oji in the western limit is a line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishikyogoku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""towns"" of 40 zhang (approximately 120 meters) square by major and minor roads running north-south, east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""条"", and a column of four towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jyucho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) even for a small lane, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for a main road."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
The Suzaku Avenue reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters).
"Also, parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi-horikawa-koji, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishi-horikawa River) flowed."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to establish a new capital under the reign of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the aristocracy and temples supporting the Emperor Tenmu line was concentrated."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu relocated the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of events, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyō's construction."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded to the construction of the city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), so it remained undeveloped until the 9th century."
"By the 10th century, the Ritsuryo system had become largely defunct, leading to widespread devastation and even the conversion of land within the capital, which was originally forbidden for agriculture, into farmland."
"Aristocratic residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital, which was close to the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Koki is a historical chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the six national histories following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD), it records a period of 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
"Edited by Fujiwara Osamu, et al."
"According to the preface, in the tenth year of the Kōnin era (819), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it."
"As the three others, excluding Otsugu, died with the task unfinished, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Naoyoshi-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Minemori, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue it."
"In the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, a further edict was issued, entrusting the execution to Fujiwara no Tsugushi, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Katori."
"Later, with the addition of Furutaka-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the completion was finally reported on December 9th, Jowa 7 (January 5th, 841)."
"The compilation took 21 years, and it was Fujiwara no Otsugu alone who was involved in the project throughout the reigns of three emperors."
"Following the ""Chronicles of Japan Continued,"" this text records the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting from the middle of Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally comprising 40 volumes, the collection was scattered until the early 15th century. It was rediscovered by Inayama Gyokyo, a student of Handa  Hokiichi, in the Sanjo-nishi family, who found 10 volumes in manuscript form (although some argue that it was actually discovered in a revised edition by Yanagihara Norimitsu). This rediscovery led to the first publication of the work."
"The extant volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kanmu), 14 and 17 (Heijo), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes.  The reign of Emperor Junna is completely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the *Nihon Kiryaku*, an abridged version of the *Six National Histories*, and the *Ruijū Kokushi*, a categorized index of the *Six National Histories*, by citing passages from both."
"There are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Itsumon"" which are collections of anecdotes from various places. Based on these, the following have been published by Shueisha's Annotated Japanese Historical Materials and Kodansha Academic Library."
The content is said to most reflect the views of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of adding short biographies (kōden) to death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent of the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the biography in this book does not fall into the usual one-sided, official praise or condemnation, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique criticisms and observations, making it an anomaly among the six national histories for its persistence in critical thinking."
"It is also known that the ""Six National Histories"" included more waka poetry than previous or subsequent historical works."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"There is also a theory that her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the five renowned poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother in the ""Goshūi Wakashū"" as ""Higaki no Ōna,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched theory."
"My great-grandfather (some say grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū."
"There are siblings, including the Head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice, a letter from him, the priest of the Flower Mountain Palace, Kaishu, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Sei Shōnagon's name, a lady-in-waiting, is said to be derived from her family name, Kiyohara, and the title of a relative, ""Shōnagon."""
"The real name is unknown, although some sources, such as the ""Makura no Sōshi Chō,"" claim it was ""Nagiko,"" but this is not reliable."
"Counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, she is known for her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collection of Sei Shonagon"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most common version has 31)."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" there are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"Her mother was Keishu-in, daughter of Konoe Takamichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He was initially a Buddhist monk, but when Yoshiki was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"He then ascended to the throne as the 15th Shogun, supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forming an alliance with Shingen Takeda and Yoshikage Asakura to encircle Nobunaga."
"Though they once cornered Nobunaga, the Ashikaga Shogunate was eventually driven from Kyoto by him, effectively ending its reign."
He then spent the rest of his life with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537 (Tenbun 6), the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofukuji) as the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and took the name Kakkei at a young age."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th Shogun, Yoshiaki, was assassinated by Matsu permanent Hideyoshi and the Three Miyoshi, and his younger brother, the abbot of Rokuon-in, Ashikaga Yoshikage, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsu permanent Hidehisa and others and confined to Kofukuji Temple (it is said that Hidehisa and others feared making Kofukuji Temple an enemy by killing Kakkei, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of Kofukuji Temple's abbot in the future, so they only confined him)."
"However, he escaped with the help of vassals such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that mention Yoshiaki refer to him by other names, including ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was driven from Kyoto and was said to have been attacked by night thieves, earning him the nickname ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly appointed to the rank of Jushi-ge and the post of Sama no Kami."
"However, while there are doubts about the exact date of his appointment, Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu Kyoki"" records that on February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), the day of the declaration of the shogunate to Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiie's rival, Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed when Yoshiaki's messenger arrived at his residence to request mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushiinoge. This clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had already been appointed before this."
"Having escaped Kyoto, Yoshitsugu initially sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province, but when Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Three Mitsuhide, Yoshitsugu fled to his sister's son, Takeda Yoshitaka in Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and conflicts among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province, seeking his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate family, at his side, and he had no intention of actively going to Kyoto with the newly-returned-to-the-lay-world Ashikaga Yoshiaki, so the trip to Kyoto did not happen."
"The role of crowning was performed by Asakura Yoshikage. (It should be noted that there are no historical records of Yoshiaki having formally come of age at this point, making his coming of age extremely late by the standards of the time.)"
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September 1568, he ascended to Kyoto, having been installed by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Counselor and Lieutenant General of the Left Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the Kyoto Station to Osaka Station section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs almost entirely parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Line (Kyoto Line) of the Hankyu Railway, and there is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so the nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as the main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodo River's right bank, parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line, with a maximum speed of 130 km/h."
It is a quadruple-track line with separate quadruple tracks for each direction (outer and inner lines).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line is equipped with the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates as an integrated service with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The line offers express trains, rapid trains, and local trains (Kyoto-Hanshin local line) that run directly to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line. It also serves special express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the San'in region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically, with the introduction of overnight express trains to Kyushu originating from Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Kii Peninsula starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" express train to the San'in region, which began operating after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all extending their routes to Kyoto."
"The Haruka, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains running regularly to Kyoto a year later. The New Osaka-Kyoto route has become a corridor of express trains, with four or so departures per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"However, all sleeper express trains between Kyoto and Kyushu were discontinued on March 15, 2008, as part of the timetable revision."
"However, southbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line depart from the Ibaraki Station (Platform 3) and enter the freight line, passing through the Suita Signal Station before arriving at Shin-Osaka."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express trains and rapid trains that run on the outer tracks on the same section, and in some cases, two express trains may enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, allowing for 130 km/h operation on the outer tracks except for a few curved sections."
"The inner track is also designed for 120 km/h, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains and special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also empty trains such as the ""Hamakaze,"" ""Tanba,"" and ""Hokkin-ki"" running on this section for entering and leaving the Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot)."
"Furthermore, the ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" trains' deadhead runs between Mukomachi and Osaka use the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is to be stored at Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the Osaka line, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer track). (The reverse route is used for departure.)"
"Therefore, the front and rear of the train formation are reversed when it's running in and out of the depot."
"The New Rapid service runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, Amagasaki and Kamigori on the Sanyo Line, and Banshu-Akō on the Akō Line, via the JR Kyoto Line, to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, Ōmi-Shiotsu Station on the Hokuriku Line, and Tsuruga."
"From midday to evening, trains operate every 15 minutes, with one daytime service to the Kosei Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
All trains operate with 8 or 12 cars using JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, a 100km long high-standard trunk road (National Route 478), runs from Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It traverses the long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture, strengthening the connection between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, revitalizing the region, and serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture refers to this road as ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the ending point. The starting point opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"" rather than ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway often refers specifically to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline portion on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kumiyama-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage by small vehicles, etc., is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll road sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and the Ayabe Angokuji IC, making it impossible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer-autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section is also expected to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, resulting in the current free section of Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT becoming a toll road."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll gate (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll gate will be established."
The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth. This eliminates all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway.
The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under development by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management structure after opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Route 9 Old Nozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyokawa IC) opened as a temporary free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugaki IC and Chiyogawa IC was reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (currently Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) with the opening of the Ayabe JCT to Maizuru-Ooe IC (provisional two-lane, two-way traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with ownership transferred to the Independent Administrative Institution Japan Highway Public Corporation and management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections where the road is in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji Temple is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompassing the entire Mount Hiei, which stands at an elevation of 848 meters."
"While it is officially known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei is more commonly referred to as Hieizan or Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"The head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The chief priest (head priest) is called the Tendai Zasū and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism, alongside Koyasan Kongobuji Temple."
"It embraced the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, as well as esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation and contemplation), and Pure Land practices, presenting itself as a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial family and nobility, wielding significant influence."
"In particular, esoteric Buddhist practices, known as ""kaji-kito,"" gained the support of the Heian aristocracy, and the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple, belonging to the Shingon sect, was called ""To-mitsu,"" while the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple was called ""Dai-mitsu,"" and the two competed for dominance."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective name for the various halls and pagodas of the three towers and sixteen valleys, scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills."
It began in 788 AD when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in.
"The temple name Enryaku-ji, which took the era name of its founding, was only granted in 824, fourteen years after Saicho's death, during the Jōnin era."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks and is considered the birthplace of Japanese Tendai Buddhism.  It has been a training ground for many founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history, including Ennin, Enchin, Ryonin (founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu), Honen (founder of Jodo sect), Shinran (founder of Jodo Shinshu), Eisai (founder of Rinzai sect), Dogen (founder of Soto sect), and Nichiren (founder of Nichiren sect).  For this reason, it is also known as the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous practices such as the ""12-year hermitage"" and ""1,000-day mountain pilgrimage"" continue to this day, making it a prominent sacred site of Japanese Buddhism and a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, whose name appears in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At Hie Shrine in Sakamoto, on the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Ōyamagui, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-o-bito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (or possibly 767) during the Tenpyo-Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he received the precepts at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a fully ordained monk."
"The young Saicho, driven by his own convictions, chose not to seek a secure position at a major temple in Nara, but instead secluded himself on Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, devoting himself to training and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Words of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Concentration and Insight"") written by the Chinese Tiantai Master Zhiyi."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjusri Hall, and a Sutra Repository at the present location of the Konponchudo, naming it Ichijo Jikan-in."
"This temple is also known as Hieizan-ji, and it was only after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824), that it was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" which took the name of the era."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devotee of Saicho, and with the support of the emperor and his close advisor, the Wake clan, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually flourished as a national defense center, guarding the north-eastern gate of Kyoto, known as the Oni-mon."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a ""Gengakushō,"" a short-term overseas student."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804 AD.
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai teachings and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts from the abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings from the abbot Gyōman."
"Furthermore, he studied Esoteric Buddhism from the Ācārya Shun'gyō at Ryūkōji Temple in Kōshū (Shaoxing) and Zen from the Zen Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While commonly considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, alternative interpretations exist (discussed later)."
"The name is also read as ""Tsukiyomi."""
"While the Kojiki records the story of the slaying of the food deity, leading to the general perception of the deity as male, the text itself does not contain any descriptions that definitively determine its gender."
"Many moon deities in other cultures are goddesses, and there are also many warlike goddesses in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the slaying of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and they support the theory that the deity was a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi, though considered the god of the moon, has varying accounts of his divinity across different texts."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, after fleeing the underworld, performed a purification ritual and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his left eye was born Tsukiyomi, and from his nose was born Susanoo, together forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" presents a different account, stating that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki,"" and emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The extent of her dominion also varies, encompassing heaven, the sea, and other inconsistent realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born in duality with Amaterasu, the sun goddess, is a concept echoed in various mythologies, as noted in the field of comparative mythology."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (from the ""Wu Yun Li Nian Ji""), there is a creation myth where Pangu's left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred later."
"Also, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, the creation of the sun and moon is described on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi can be considered to follow the pattern of the sun and moon origin myth, a common motif found worldwide, where the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall activity is limited."
"Only a brief mention of the origin of grains is found in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the ""Nihon Shoki."""
"There is also a theory that this balances out by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, who have contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures are also found in the relationship between Amenominakanushi, Takamimusubi, and Kamimusubi, and in the relationship between Hosuseri, Hoori (Yamahiko), and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure in Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and [another deity] are the same god, as their domains and stories overlap in part."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, this deity was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and is called one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""announce the food of the night,"" but he has no further exploits after this."
There is also a theory that Izanami is in the Yomi no Kuni.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo-ki simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose brilliance rivaled the sun's, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different account in the First Book states that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi."
"While some stories describe Amaterasu Omikami being instructed to rule the heavens alongside another deity, others tell of her being tasked with ""ruling the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean,"" likely stemming from the belief that the moon controls the tides. This parallel existence of multiple creation myths for the three deities is noteworthy."
"In the eleventh book of the fifth section of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. Later, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was ordered by Amaterasu to meet Uke Mochi, the Food Goddess, in the heavens. He descended to meet her."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as a gesture of hospitality, vomited rice from her mouth, and Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto, angered by this, killed her with his sword."
"From the body of the food deity, cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice were born, which became the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji, a term referring to a government official in ancient Japan, belonged to the Onmyōryō, a division of the Ministry of Central Affairs under the Ritsuryō system."
"The official position, initially assigned to practitioners of divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, later expanded beyond the original legal regulations to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"After the Middle Ages, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various regions. In modern times, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sound of ""n"" being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in the Xia and Shang dynasties of ancient China and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are constituted by combinations of these principles. This philosophy, along with closely related disciplines such as astronomy, calendrical systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping, was transmitted to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) during the Asuka period (5th-6th centuries), no later than 512 CE (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 CE (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when I Ching scholars arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little influence on politics and culture, in 602 AD, Kanroku, considered the pioneer of Onmyōdō in Japan, arrived from Baekje and lectured to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shōtoku, which significantly impacted the nation's governance."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), envoys were sent to Sui, a leading civilization, to absorb Buddhism, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendrical methods.  The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought is also evident in the Seventeen Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of nobility."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, where the envoys stopped, to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to determine good fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the Five Elements (五行) theory of mutual generation and mutual overcoming, thereby predicting the future and obtaining guidance for all aspects of life.""  As a result, Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory gained prominence as a means of judging auspiciousness and misfortune, and establishing behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination and deeply versed in the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, even using divination by the ""shi"" during the Jinshin War, established the ""Onmyōryō"" and Japan's first astronomical observatory in 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyōji"" began in 685 (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the growing popularity of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought. In 718, the Yōrō Code officially established the Onmyōryō, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Yin-Yang masters, calendar experts, and clock experts. This officially recognized the practice of divination alongside the divination conducted by the Shinto priests."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as doctors and onmyoji, and they were mostly immigrants who were well-versed in various academic disciplines and proficient in reading classical Chinese. These included scholars who had returned from the Former Han, Later Han, Sui (which replaced them as the dominant power on the mainland), Goguryeo and Baekje (which held sway on the west coast of the Korean peninsula), and occasionally Silla (which initially held power on the east coast of the Korean peninsula)."
"Particularly, following the defeat at the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (Tenchi 2), when Japan sent reinforcements to Baekje, its close ally, Silla unified the Korean peninsula and the Baekje dynasty collapsed. In the period before and after this event, a large number of intellectuals from Baekje came to Japan as refugees, many of whom were appointed to government positions."
"In its early days, the Yin Yang Office's expertise was purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern-day Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and the management of clepsydras. They primarily engaged in astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of events through theoretical analysis based on Yin Yang and Five Elements principles. They did not engage in religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, they played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects within the Imperial Court, and in divining the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of land and directions, which proved vital during relocation of the capital."
