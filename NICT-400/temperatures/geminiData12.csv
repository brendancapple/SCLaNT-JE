The Doshisha is a school corporation to which Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College belong.
"Doshisha University was founded in 1875 by Joseph Hardy Neesima as a Christian institution based on Protestant Congregationalism. It is a comprehensive educational institution with nine educational institutions bearing the name ""Doshisha"", ranging from university to kindergarten (as of April 2005)."
"As of April 2004, approximately 36,000 students were enrolled at Doshisha."
"Doshisha University currently holds an <AA+> rating from Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I)."
<AA+> is the second highest rating on a 21-level scale.
"Along with Waseda University and Keio University, it ranks among the top educational institutions."
"The founding spirit of Doshisha is ""conscience,"" based on the Christian spirit."
"Jirō  Nishima envisioned his educational institution to cultivate individuals who would ""apply their conscience to their skills."""
"We aspire to nurture individuals whose ""conscience fills their whole being"" by pursuing ""moral education"" based on Christianity alongside academic knowledge, ensuring a balanced development."

"Furthermore, the educational philosophy of ""Christianity,"" ""Liberalism,"" and ""Internationalism"" has been proposed as a concrete means of realizing this ""conscience"" education, aiming to produce individuals who will become the ""conscience of the nation."""
A Protestant school corporation with roots in the Congregationalist tradition.
"However, unlike so-called mission schools, its main purpose is not Christian evangelization (it does not use education as a means of evangelization)."
"A school corporation whose predecessor is Doshisha English School, founded in 1875 by Jō  Niijima, one of the six great educators of the Meiji era."
"In 1875, Joseph Hardy Neesima founded Doshisha English School in Kyoto's Teramachi-dori, Maruta-machi."

Ikkyū Sōjun was a Zen monk of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism in the Muromachi period.
Known as the model of storytelling.
"For ""Ikkyū-san's Anecdotes of Wit,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-dō"" (this page also has a brief description), and for the television anime ""Ikkyū-san,"" see the entry for ""Ikkyū-san."""
"Born in Kyoto, a descendant of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"The August 1 entry in the diary of Sugawara Kazunaga, ""Higashibōjō Kazunaga Kyōki,"" from the year 1494, reads, ""It is said in secret tradition that Ikkyū Zenji was a hidden prince, the son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkiku-maru."
"He was later known as Zhou Jian, and used the aliases Kuang Yunzi, Xia Lu, and Meng Gui."
"The Buddhist name is ""Soshu,"" which can also be written as ""Soushun."""
Ikyu is a Dharma name.
"(See the ""Kaimyo"" section for information on Kaimyo and Dohgo.)"
"At age six, he entered the Ankokuji temple's Zōgaishūkan and received the precepts, taking the name Chūken."
"His poetic talent emerged early, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao"" written at age 13 and ""Chunyi Suhua"" written at age 15 gained fame and praise in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi and took the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this time, while it cannot be definitively determined if it was due to the passing of his master, Ikkyū attempted suicide."
"He became a disciple of the high priest, Kaso Sodon, of Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto in 1415 (Oei 22)."
"After responding to the koan ""Dongshan's Three Meals of Sticks"" with the words, ""From the world of existence to the world of non-existence, a moment's rest. If it rains, let it rain. If it blows, let it blow,""  Ikkū received his Dharma name from Kasō."
"""Aroji"" (lit. ""with leakage"") refers to the world of delusion, while ""muroji"" (lit. ""without leakage"") refers to the world of enlightenment."
"One night in 1420, the sound of crows made him suddenly realize the truth."
"Hasso intended to give Ikkyu a certificate of authorization, but Ikkyu declined."
"He sent Huasou away with laughter, calling him a fool."
"After that, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verses, calligraphy, painting, and eccentricities."
"In 1428, Emperor Shōkō died without male heirs, and Emperor Go-Hanazono from the Fushimi-no-miya family was enthroned."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation led to Emperor Go-Hachijo's enthronement.
"From the ""Chronological Record of Ikkyū Sōjō, the First in the East."""
"However, Imazumi Sukuo argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was solely due to the shogunate's approval and that Ikkyū's recommendation had no bearing on it."
"Appointed as the 47th head priest of Daitoku-ji Temple in 1474, six years after the Onin War, by the Imperial decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, he dedicated himself to the temple's restoration without actually residing there."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, located in Kamigyoku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Preserved in 1877 (Meiji 10), following the Emperor's move to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) during the Meiji Restoration."
It is also known as Kyoto Imperial Palace since the Meiji era.
"The Imperial Palace, originally located within the inner palace near the center of Heian-kyo, was relocated to the Sato-no-uchi (Inner Palace) due to devastation caused by wars and other calamities."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Inner Palace was one of the provincial palaces, where the emperors of the Northern Court, later known as the Jimyōin line, resided for generations."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at the Nijō-Tomikoji Palace."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but was expanded based on it."
"Normally, it can be visited by applying, but it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and workplace of successive emperors until the Emperor's move to Tokyo in 1869.
"Kyoto Imperial Palace, in the present era (21st century), is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is state-owned."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, and across the Imadegawa-dori Street to the north, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both with their Imadegawa campuses)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Daimyoji Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the surrounding Kyoto Gyoen National Garden."
"Kyoto citizens often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, as ""Gosho."""
"While unlike overseas castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high, some theorize that this reflects a difference in the level of intimacy between the common people and the rulers (like the Emperor and other members of the Imperial Family) in Eastern and Western cultures."
"For example, the fact that an event like the French Revolution, where commoners invaded the Palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruling monarch, has never occurred in Japan, is one basis for this kind of consideration."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably further west than the present Kyoto Imperial Palace, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near Nishi-Nihon Railway's Nijo Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the Satō-no-Uchi, called the Tsuchimikado Higashi-tōin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in the first year of Genkō (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that once stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period, six of which were due to fires. The existing building, known as the Ansei Palace, was reconstructed in 1855 during the Ansei era, following the Heian architectural style."
"In 1877, during a visit to Kyoto, Emperor Meiji, who had resided in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, lamented the state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair just ten years after his departure for Tokyo. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its former appearance."
"Major buildings include the Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokamonjo, Tsunego-ten, Koshun, Osuzumisho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration, when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law, established in 1889, stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai (Great Rice Harvest Festival) would be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa performed their enthronement ceremonies in the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any location, such as Kyoto, for the ceremony. In 1990, when the current Emperor ascended the throne, the Enthronement Ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the formal throne of the Emperor where he sits during his enthronement, symbolically signifying his accession, is located in the Shishinden of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily moved to the Imperial Palace."
"A four-legged gate with bare wood, gable roof, cypress bark shingles, and a column spacing of one ken."
"The gates are only opened for special events, such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or for public access."
"The two Tsujibi walls each feature five horizontal lines, a mark of the highest rank in wall construction."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-tiled Jomeimon Gate, you will find the Shishinden directly in front of you."
"Gagaku is a form of traditional music from Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
This will focus primarily on Japanese Gagaku (an Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gaku-bu of the Imperial Household Agency.
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" in contrast to ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music, the Imperial Household Agency, the term ""Gagaku"" refers to the repertoire performed by the department, excluding Western music."
Much of it is preserved as instrumental music in court music.
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world that is still performed in large ensembles.
"However, as a true ensemble form of gagaku, it was interrupted for over 100 years after the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa shogunate brought together the descendants of musicians (gakka) and reorganized it. Therefore, the extent to which it inherited the form of the Heian period is questionable."
"It can be inferred that the musical notation for the hichiriki, written in katakana, is sung as a ""shōga,""  a method of singing the melody by applying musical notation to the text, in a way that faithfully reflects the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century, including the pronunciation of the ""ha"" sound as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo."""
"The notation of the Gakubiwa, written in kanji characters, shares many similarities with the pipa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China, and further suggests the inheritance of a style that originated from an ancient continent."
"The most important historical document is considered to be ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Tsukia (1450-1512), who was concerned about the loss of records of Gagaku (court music) due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū, a member of the Shōgakusha, compiled a record of gagaku and bugaku centered on the shō, a valuable document on ancient gagaku."
"It is based on ceremonial music transmitted from China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, Gagaku was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently played in Japanese gagaku, those believed to have originated in China, known as Tōgaku, are said to be based on the music played at banquets in the Tang dynasty, known as Yen-yueh."
"The music categories include names with international flavor, such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lâm Ấp music (Champa music), indicating that they incorporated elements of ancient Japanese music predating the arrival of music from the continent."
"Before modern times, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha (Nara) were considered the three major music institutions."
"These musical centers were called to Tokyo in modern times, becoming the foundation for the present-day Imperial Household Agency's musical ensembles, but the traditions of each ensemble continue in their respective regions."
"It has also been influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chanting, resulting in a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces are being passed down through the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics are based on S-country style kabuki.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some consider this to be the only definition of gagaku).
"Left Dance, Tang Music... Chinese, Indian, and Lin Yi (Southern Vietnam) styles."
"Right Dance, Koryo Music... Korean, Bohai (Northeast China)"
This includes songs produced in Japan (Hon-Gak) that imitate the aforementioned style.
Songs composed during the Heian period.
The lyrics reference a ballad.
Kokufu Kabuki and Yōkyoku are sometimes collectively referred to as ancient songs.
Emperor Kanmu (737–806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born in 737 as the first son of Emperor Shirakawa (later Emperor Kōnin).
"The ""Kono Shin-gasa"" of Mother is recorded in the ""Nihon Shoki"" as a descendant of the Baekje royal family, with King Mu of Baekje as their ancestor."
"Empress Fujiwara no Eto, gave birth to Anden (later Emperor Heizei) and Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while his consort Fujiwara no Tabiko bore Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended the throne, his mother, Takano Shin-kasa, was of low-born repatriated descent from the Wa clan. Therefore, becoming crown prince was not expected. Initially, he aspired to a career as an official, serving in positions such as chamberlain, head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, due to political struggles involving the Fujiwara clan, among others, his half-brother, the former Crown Prince Oto-no-miya, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and he was appointed Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was relocated to Yamashiro Province."
"In the beginning, a capital was built in Nagaoka in 784, but it was replaced by a new capital, Heian-kyō, in 794."
"Again, an army led by Sakano-ue no Tamuramaro was sent to conquer the Tohoku region and subdue the Emishi."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsugunori of the Fujiwara clan for the suffering that such military and construction projects were inflicting on the peasants."
He is said to have proposed the compilation of the Chronicles of Japan.
"It was during the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kūkai returned from Tang China, bringing new life to Japanese Buddhism."
"The reign of Empress Shoken, marked by the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Toda, was also shadowed by the exile and death in 785 of Prince Sawara, her younger brother and designated Crown Prince. He was banished on charges of being involved in the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19th, 800, Emperor Kanmu posthumously honored Prince Kujo as Emperor Sudo, designated the tomb of Princess Inoue as an imperial mausoleum, and restored her to the rank of Empress."
"While known as a patron of Saicho and Kukai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Sects of Nara,"" including the confiscation of their estates, because of their involvement in government and their excessive power."
"Furthermore, it is said that the chaos within the imperial palace also contributed to the later ""Incident of Yakushi,"" serving as a breeding ground for it."
"Passed away on March 17, 806 (Year 25 of the Enryaku era)."
He was given the posthumous title Yamato-neko-Amatsu-hitsugi-iya-derino-Mikoto.
"He was posthumously given the Chinese-style temple name, Emperor Kanmu."
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkoku Ossebari no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The tomb is said to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum in Momo Yama-cho, Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City."
"He had been insistent on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at Kashiwabara-ryō in Fushimi."
He was enshrined in Heian Shrine as the first Emperor of Heian-kyo during the Meiji era.
"Moreover, all emperors are enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three halls within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in his traditional press conference before his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in part of his comments regarding the upcoming co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, stated, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea as the *Nihon Shoki* records that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"This statement, though not widely reported in Japan, became a major news story and generated much discussion in Korean media."
"Some reports made significant leaps in logic, claiming that the Imperial Family has Korean ancestry and promoting the theory of Baekje origins of the Imperial House."
"The Ohtani family is the house name of the descendants of Kakukei, son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hino Hirotsuna was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect of Buddhism, and the hereditary head (Hoshū) of the Honzanji temple, the largest sect of Jodo Shinshu."
"Both the head priest of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priest of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinsoh-byo), which split in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji Era."
"The origin of the Otani surname stems from the establishment of the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned below, at Otani, the northern gate of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Eastern Hills."
"While Hongan-ji Temple, during the Sengoku period (Japan), was a force to be reckoned with alongside the warlords due to the spread of the Ikkō-ikki, and is often counted among them, and while the temple's head priest's Dharma names (Jōdo Shinshū) and personal names often included ""Hongan-ji,"" as in ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" or ""Hongan-ji Kōsa,"" these are merely for convenience. The Hongan-ji lineage never adopted ""Hongan-ji"" as their family name or surname, and there was never a ""Hongan-ji"" clan."
"Jaku Shinni was present at Shinran's deathbed in 1262 and built a hall to house his remains in 1272 near her home in Ohtani, eastern Kyoto."
"The Otani Temple, venerated by Jodo Shinshu followers as the mausoleum of Shinran, was entrusted to Kakkei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, as its steward."
"However, due to the Ogyo Temple attracting pilgrims and donations from various regions, a dispute over the position of absentee abbot arose between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and Izen, Kakkei's half-brother. Kakunyo narrowly won the struggle, establishing the hereditary succession of the absentee abbot by his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, marking the birth of the Otani Hongwanji Temple."
"Since then, the Hongan-ji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, established a religious organization. During the Muromachi period, under the 5th head priest Shaknyo, it expanded into the Hokuriku region. By the time of the 7th head priest Jonnyo, the Hongan-ji sect had been established in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had actively worked on establishing their organizations after Shinran's death, the formation of the Honganji Temple lagged significantly. During the early Muromachi period, the Honganji Temple was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in Temple, and the Otani family is said to have served as a steward for the Konoe family, through their connection with the Hino family (Shinran's family)."
"In the late 15th century, the Honganji sect spread throughout Japan under the leadership of the eighth abbot, Rennyo. However, in 1465, the Otani Honganji was destroyed, forcing the abbot to relocate to Yoshizaki in Echizen and later to Yamashina in the outskirts of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of Rennyo's teachings in Kaga, the Kaga Ikkō-ikki uprising occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the Togashi clan, the guardian of Kaga, by the Honganji Buddhist sect. This resulted in a situation known as ""a country ruled by farmers."""
"For nearly a century, up to 1580, the country was practically ruled by the Ikko sect."
"Entering the 16th century, amid the turbulent Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength reaching from small farmers to samurai and local lords, intensified its activities across Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple was destroyed by fire in 1532 during the Tenbun-Hoka War. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, relocated to the Ishiyama Gobo temple, established by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), which came to be known as Ishiyama Honganji."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the top of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a vital river transportation hub at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"With Ishiyama Hongan-ji as their base, Shōnyo forged close relationships with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the Hongan-ji's power base."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōnyo era, some members of the Honganji Buddhist sect, particularly in regions such as Hokuriku, began to deviate from the central control of the Honganji Temple and pursue their own independent paths."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kennyo, the Honganji Temple sect, which had effectively become an autonomous daimyo power, clashed with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified rule by advancing into the Kinai region and seizing control from religious forces."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple, led by Kannon, entrenched in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple, and their followers throughout the land resisting Oda forces, giving the Honganji Temple the upper hand and causing significant trouble for Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had regained Echizen from the Oda clan, were crushed. This suppressed resistance across the land, and in 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with Honganji, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, marking a string of defeats for Honganji outside its own territory."
"While the Honganji Temple continued to maintain its strength with the support of the Saika Shu and others, it gradually became isolated among its enemies. Finally, in 1580, it succumbed to Nobunaga, who had obtained an Imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and was forced to evacuate from Ishiyama Honganji.  Thus, the Honganji Temple as a territorial power ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyoju, argued against following Kyonyo's wishes and for continuing the resistance, causing a rift between them. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Junyo, was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, the Hongwanji Temple began to split over the position of its head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Jōruri a separate temple site, establishing the Higashi Hongwanji Temple, separate from Junnyo's Hongwanji Temple."
"At this time, many followers moved from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, and the Honganji temple split into two."
"Originally the sons of the court noble Hino Arimitsu, both the Eastern and Western Otani family heads, descended from the bloodlines of Shinran and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), respectively, followed a tradition of being adopted by powerful court nobles.  They also continued to intermarry with court nobles throughout generations, further solidifying their noble lineage through their maternal lines."
Kyoutanabe City is located near the border with Osaka and Nara prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Idecho Town in Tsuzuki District, Seika Town in Soraku District, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture, situated at the center of a triangular region encompassing three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River flowing north-south on the eastern side and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city is bisected by the West Japan Railway's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka are heavily characterized as bedroom towns."
"April 1, 1997 (Heisei 9), City status was granted, formerly Tsuzuki District, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe-cho, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, which was to be designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"", was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" by adding ""Kyoto's 'Kyo'"" to the name. The town-to-city conversion (municipal implementation) and the renaming of ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" were implemented on the same day."
"Moreover, the new city name was selected from public submissions."
"It is famous for its thriving tea (Uji tea) cultivation and its specialty, gyokuro."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City.
"Keihan Uji Bus (commenced operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."
"May 10, 2008, bus depot relocation."
Companies with offices in the city
"Yamajiro-Tanabe Post Office (610-03) (Delivery area also includes neighboring Itecho, Tsuzuki County)"
"Kannonji Temple (Kyotanabe City), home to the National Treasure Eleven-faced Kannon Standing Statue."
The seated statue of Ikkū Sōjun and the scenic garden are designated Important Cultural Properties.
"The city's main stations include Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyoutanabe Station serve as the central stations for the Kyoutanabe City center, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the center station for the Keishin Higashi Rose Town."
"Furthermore, Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line local trains also run to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyoutanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to coincide with the city's establishment.
This is the same case as Hankyu Kyoto Line Nishi-Mukai Station and Higashi-Mukai Station.
"Although Kii-Tanabe Station (Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, the use of ""Kii"", the former province name of Wakayama Prefecture, in the station name is likely to avoid duplication with other stations within the same West Japan Railway Company network."
"Keihan Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located within the city)"
"Keihan Uji Bus (Keihan Group, Keihan Uji Bus Kyotanabe Depot is located in the city)"
"Musashi Province was a former Japanese administrative division, one of the Ritsuryo Provinces."
"This corresponds to the area encompassing present-day Saitama and Tokyo excluding the areas east of the Sumida River and all islands, as well as the northeastern portion of Kanagawa prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in Engi-shiki, provincial ranking classification, remote provinces."
"Heian-kyō, established in 794 (Enryaku 13) by Emperor Kanmu, was the capital of Japan."
"Heian-kyō, located in what is now the central part of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, was a walled city built on the border of  Katsunogun and Atago-gun counties in Yamashiro Province. It was laid out in a rectangular shape, spanning 4.5 kilometers east to west and 5.2 kilometers north to south."
"They established the Imperial Palace in the north-central part of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue running through the center of the city from the palace, dividing the city into left and right capitals (with the left capital on the east and the right capital on the west)."
"The floor plan is fundamentally modeled after Heijokyo, and emulates the Sui and Tang dynasties' Chang'an."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the Chinese concept of ""Four Symbols"" (Sishin Soou), derived from the principles of Feng Shui."
Heian-kyō was smaller than present-day Kyoto City.
"The northernmost main street, Ichijo Oji, is Ichijo Street, located between present-day Imadegawa Dori and Marutamachi Dori."
"The Southern Limit of the Ninth Avenue is currently Kujō Street, just south of JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Grand Avenue corresponds to present-day Teramachi-dori.
The estimated location of the Saigyo-ku Oji in the western limit is the line connecting the JR San-in Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Line Saikyo-ku Station from north to south.
"The inner city was divided into ""machi"" (blocks), each measuring 40 jo (approximately 120 meters) square, by major and minor roads running east-west and north-south."
"A group of four rows of towns aligned east-west (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""条"", and a group of four columns of towns aligned north-south is called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same district were each numbered.
"This resulted in each town being named like ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juyoncho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 zhang (about 12 meters) for even the smallest lanes, and 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or more for major roads."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
It reached a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters) at Zhuque Avenue.
"Also, rivers (Horikawa River (Kyoto Prefecture), Nishihorikawa River) flowed parallel to Horikawa Koji and Nishihorikawa Koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyō in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been an attempt to build a new capital under the lineage of Emperor Tenji, breaking away from Yamato Province, where the power of the nobility and temples supporting the lineage of Emperor Tenmu was concentrated."
"However, only ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent dethronement of Prince Sawara, and the slow progress of the construction of Nagaoka-kyō."
The construction of Heian-kyō is believed to have started with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) and then proceeded with the construction of the city (Kyō).
"However, the right bank of Kyoto was a wetland formed by the Katsura River (a tributary of the Yodo River) and thus remained undeveloped until the 9th century."
"Even in the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become a formality, the capital was in such decline that farmland, which was strictly forbidden within its boundaries, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"Noble residences were established in the left capital, except for the northern part of the right capital near the Imperial Palace."
"The Nihon Kōki, compiled in the early Heian period, is an official historical work that follows the Shoku Nihongi and is the third of the Six National Histories."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840 AD, Japan), it chronicles a period of 42 years, from the 11th year of Enryaku (792 AD) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833 AD)."
Edited by Fujiwara Tsuguo and others.
"According to the preface, Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Otsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Rizen no Yasuyoshi to compile it in the 10th year of the Kōnin era (819 AD)."
"As three of the original four, excluding the heir apparent, died before the task was completed, Emperor Junwa later issued an edict ordering Kiyohara Natsuo, Naoe-ō, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mineyuki, Sakanoe Imatsuki, and Shimada Kiyota to continue the work."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyō, further edicts were issued, appointing Fujiwara no Tsugu, Minamoto no Tsune, Fujiwara no Yoshino, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, and Asano no Katori to carry out the tasks."
"Later, with the addition of Furukani Takaniwa and Yamada Kototsu, the completion was finally reported on December 9, Jowa 7 (January 5, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, a project spanning three emperors, and藤原緒嗣 was the only one who consistently participated throughout."
"Continuing after the ""Nihon Shoki"", this chronicles the reigns of Emperors Heizei, Saga, and Junna, starting midway through Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Originally consisting of forty volumes, the collection was scattered until the early 15th century. Later, Inayama Gyokyo, a disciple of  Hanawa Hokiichi, discovered ten volumes in a copy at the Sanjo Nishi family (although some believe it was a corrected version by Yanagihara Norimitsu) and it was published for the first time."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, and 13 (Kōkan), 14 and 17 (Heizei), and 20, 21, 22, and 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes. The reign of Emperor Junna is entirely missing."
"It is possible to reconstruct the text of the ""Nihon Kiryaku,"" an abridged version of the ""Six National Histories,"" to a certain extent by quoting from it and from the ""Ruiju Kokushi,"" a classification of the ""Six National Histories."""
"Among the collections of historical anecdotes from various sources, there are ""Nihon Itsushi"" and ""Nihon Goki Itsubun."" Based on these works, the following books have been published by Shueisha and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
It is said that the content most reflects the views of Fujiwara no Otsugu.
"The practice of including short biographies (kōden) in death notices of emperors and courtiers, following the example of the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was continued in subsequent historical records."
"However, the biography in this book avoids one-sided or official praise and condemnation, and instead contains many intriguing descriptions infused with unique criticisms and observations. This makes it unique among the Six National Histories for its steadfast adherence to critical thinking."
It is also known that the Six National Histories contained more waka poems than preceding and succeeding historical texts.
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"While some sources claim her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, her true identity remains unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the Five Poets of the Pear Garden and a renowned poet."
"There is an old legend that identifies the mother in ""The Second Anthology of Japanese Poetry"" as ""Higaki no Ōna,"" but this is nothing more than a far-fetched and unfounded theory."
"My great-grandfather (though some say grandfather) was Ki no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashu."
"Among his brothers and sisters are the Head of Gagaku, Tameari, the Vice-Minister of the Left, a letter sent by Kishu, the Head Priest of the Kazan-in Palace, and a woman who married the brother of Fujiwara no Yorinobu (mother of Fujiwara no Michinaga)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a court lady's name, with ""Sei"" taken from the surname Kiyohara and ""Shonagon"" from a title held by a relative."
"The real name is unknown, though some speculate it was ""Nagiko"" (according to ""Makura no Sōshi Chō""), but this is not credible."
"He is counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, and his small collection of 42 poems, ""The Anthology of Sei Shonagon,"" (the number of poems varies depending on the version, 31 in the most widely circulated one) is preserved."
"Included in the Imperial Anthologies following the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" this work has fourteen poems."
"Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and final shōgun of the Muromachi shogunate, reigning from 1568 to 1588."
"His father was Ashikaga Yoshiharu, the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate."
"His mother was Keishu-in, the daughter of Konoe Nobutada."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his half-brother."
"He had initially entered the priesthood, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yūsai and other retainers."
"He was then supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and ascended to Kyoto, becoming the 15th Shogun."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, and in alliance with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, form a network to encircle him."
"Though he briefly cornered Nobunaga, he was eventually driven out of Kyoto by the warlord, effectively ending the Muromachi shogunate."
He then spent his remaining years with the support of Mōri Terumoto and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born on November 13, 1537 (Tenbun 6), the second son of the 12th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Yoshiaki, was the heir, he entered the priesthood at a young age, becoming a foster son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, and assuming the Buddhist name Kakkei at the Ichijoin temple of Kofukuji."
He later rose to the position of Gon-shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In the Eiroku 8th year (1565) during the Eiroku Incident, Yoshiaki, the 13th shogun, was assassinated by Matsu permanent Hideyoshi and the Three Miyoshi, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Shukou, the chief priest of Rokuen-in, was also lured to his death."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others and imprisoned in the Kofuku-ji temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others refrained from killing Kakkei because they feared making the Kofuku-ji temple an enemy, as Kakkei was the younger brother of the Shogun and was promised the position of Kofuku-ji temple head priest in the future.)"
"However, he was helped by retainers such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa to escape, and on February 17, 1566, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books that chronicle Yoshiaki are known to have referred to him by aliases, such as ""Buke Gosho."""
"He was said to have been attacked by night robbers when he fled the capital and was also known as the ""Poor Shogun."""
"On April 21, he was secretly appointed to the position of Left Horse Superintendent with the rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade."
"However, while there are doubts about the date of his appointment, according to Sanka Ietsugu's ""Ietsugu Kyoki,"" on the day of the shogunate proclamation for Ashikaga Yoshiie, Yoshiaki's rival, in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), a messenger from Yoshiaki appeared at Ietsugu's mansion, where Ietsugu was serving as the messenger for the proclamation, and requested his assistance in promoting him to the rank of Jushi no ge. This incident, recorded in ""Ietsugu Kyoki,"" clearly indicates that Yoshiaki had been appointed prior to this date."
"Having fled Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikatsu and Yoshiharu father-and-son in Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Three, leading Yoshitsugu to flee to his sister's son-in-law, Takeda Yoshitaka of Wakasa Province, in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal strife over the headship and power struggles among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to the protection of Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and requested his aid in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage, who already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate, in his custody, was not willing to make a serious attempt to ascend to Kyoto with the newly-returned-to-the-world Ashikaga Yoshiaki. Therefore, the attempt to ascend to Kyoto did not come to fruition."
"The role of crown-giver was performed by Asakura Yoshikage (it should be noted that there are absolutely no historical documents that prove Yoshiaki formally came of age at this point in time, and his coming of age was exceptionally late by the standards of the time)."
"Later, through the mediation of Mitsuhide Akechi, a senior retainer of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the protection of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of 1568, he ascended to the capital, supported by Oda Nobunaga."
"On October 18th, he was appointed the 15th Shogun by the court."
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade and appointed to the positions of Sangi (Councilor) and Left Division Guard Captain."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway for almost its entire length. There is also the Kintetsu Kyoto Line operated by Kintetsu, and both lines connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station. To avoid confusion, the nickname ""JR"" is used."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is positioned as a main line along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"The New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 28 minutes, covering 42.8 km along the Yodogawa River's right bank, running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Line (maximum speed 130 km/h)."
The entire section is a quadruple-track line with separate quadruple tracks (outer and inner lines).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru, ICOCA, Suica, TOICA, and PiTaPa."
The entire line has adopted a Hankyu Line operation management system.
It operates as an integrated service with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"The station also serves JR Kobe Line, Biwako Line rapid trains, express trains, local trains (Kyoto-Hanshin Local Line), as well as limited express trains to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport and the Sanin region."
"Also, nearly half of the local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"The JR restructuring led to significant increases in express train frequencies on this stretch, with new through services from Kyoto connecting to Kyushu sleeper trains originating in Shin-Osaka, South Kii express trains from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" service to the San'in region, which began operating after the opening of the Chizu Express Line."
"Launched concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, the Haruka (train) soon saw all its trains extended to Kyoto on a regular basis one year later.  The Shin-Osaka to Kyoto route became a corridor of express trains, with four departures per hour including the Hokuriku line's ""Thunderbird"" and other trains."
"However, all sleeping car express trains departing from Kyoto to Kyushu were discontinued in the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"Furthermore, down express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka enter Shin-Osaka via the freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and through the Suita signal box."
"Therefore, it takes slightly longer than express and rapid trains running on the outer tracks over the same section, and sometimes two express trains enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The line from Kyoto to Osaka is mostly very well-aligned, with the outer track capable of 130km/h operation except for a few curved sections."
"While the inner track also supports 120 km/h speeds, express trains never use it (though there are exceptions for empty runs or special trains)."
The following express trains run on this section.
"In addition, transfer trains for the ""Hamakaze"", ""Tanba"", and ""Hokkin-ki"" trains pass through this section for entering and leaving Mukomachi (Kyoto General Depot)."
"The ""Thunderbird,"" ""Raicho,"" and ""Kitaguni"" freight trains between Mukomachi and Osaka are routed via the Kita-kamago freight line."
"When a down Osaka-bound train is brought into Kyoto General Depot, it proceeds down the down line from Osaka Station, passes through Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita-Osaka Freight Line from the west, and then merges onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line). (The reverse route is used when the train leaves the depot.)"
"Therefore, the front and back of the train formation are reversed when it is running in and out."
"The New Rapid train runs directly from Himeji on the JR Kobe Line, to Amikan, Kamigori on the Sanyo Line, to Banshu-Ako on the Ako Line, through the JR Kyoto Line, and to Nagahama on the Biwako Line, to Omi-Shiotsu on the Hokuriku Line, and finally to Tsuruga."
"From daytime to nighttime, trains operate every 15 minutes. During the daytime, one train will go to the Kosei Line while the other three will continue directly to the Biwako Line."
All four lines run direct to the Biwako Line at night.
"All trains are operated with JR West 223 series 1000 and 2000 series trains, in 8 or 12-car formations."
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway, extending approximately 100 km, is a high-standard trunk road (National Route 478) starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture, and ending in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Running lengthwise through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, this road strengthens the connection between the north and south of the prefecture, aiming to revitalize the region while also serving as the southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, which has a weak high-standard road network."
"The Governor of Kyoto refers to this road as ""Kyoto's backbone."""
"Currently, three sections are open: the starting point, the central section, and the end point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-Shi Bypass"", not ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway""."
"Also, it is often the case that the term ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway"" refers only to the Kyoto Tanba Road."
"The mainline section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side will not end here, but will be extended as the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard road, to the Tottori IC on the Tottori Expressway and San'in Expressway."
"However, the section between Kumiyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passing through it with a small truck or similar is impossible."
"Therefore, ETC installation work is currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5 meters in width are unable to pass.
"Toll Roads (Ayabe-Miyazu Road managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, others by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there are no exits between the Ayabe Kita Main Toll Gate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Angokuji IC, and it's not possible to drive only on the free section."
"The Kyotanabe Wachi IC to Ayabe Angokuji section, scheduled to open in summer/autumn 2008, is expected to be managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation.  Simultaneously, the Ayabe Angokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also come under the corporation's management, resulting in the current free section between Ayabe Angokuji IC and Ayabe JCT being subject to tolls."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita-Honsen toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and a new Ayabe Ankokuji toll plaza will be constructed."
"The current Ayabe Angokuji IC has no toll booth, eliminating all toll booths on the Ayabe Miyazu Expressway."
"The current Ayabe Kita Main Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is constructed with a temporary, prefabricated structure."
"The Tanba IC - Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism with a scheduled opening in fiscal year 2014. However, the management system following the opening remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: General National Route 9, Onozaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and General National Route 9, Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyokawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road between Kutsugata IC and Chiyodagawa IC is reclassified from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC - Chiyo River IC opened as a toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) opened between Ayabe JCT and Maizuru-Oe IC (two-lane, opposing traffic)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with their assets transferred to the Japan Highway Public Corporation and their management transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate sections that are in service.
"Also, areas with a ■ background color in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is not yet complete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryakuji Temple, located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, encompasses the entire 848m high Mount Hiei as its grounds."
"While known as Enryaku-ji Temple, Mount Hiei is often referred to as Hieizan, or simply Eizan."
It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto) and was also called Hokurei.
"The head temple of Japanese Tendai Buddhism, founded by the monk Saicho (767-822) in the early Heian period."
The abbot (chief priest) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the affiliated temples.
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a center of Heian Buddhism alongside Koyasan Kongofukuji Temple."
"It embraced the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, Esoteric Buddhism, Zen (Shikan), and Pure Land Buddhism, presenting itself as a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian Period, it gained the patronage of the Imperial Family and aristocracy, wielding considerable influence."
"In particular, esoteric practices, especially those involving incantations and prayers, gained significant support from the Heian aristocracy. The esoteric Buddhism of Tōji Temple, belonging to the Shingon sect, was called ""Tōmitsu,"" while the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple was called ""Daimitsu,"" and the two schools fiercely competed for dominance."
"Enryakuji is a collective term for the various halls and pagodas scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, from the summit to the eastern foothills, including the East Pagoda, West Pagoda, Yokawa, and other structures in its Sixteen Valleys."
It began in the year 788 when Saicho built a hermitage called Ichijō Shikan-in.
"The temple name, Enryaku-ji, after the era name of its founding, was only permitted in 824 AD, fourteen years after Saicho's death, during the弘仁 era."
"Enryakuji Temple has produced numerous renowned monks, including Ennin, Enchin, who laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, Ryonin, the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen, the founder of Jodo Buddhism, Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai, the founder of Rinzai Zen, Dogen, the founder of Soto Zen, and Nichiren, the founder of Nichiren Buddhism.  Many of the founders of new Buddhist sects and prominent figures in Japanese Buddhist history practiced on Mount Hiei in their youth, which is why it is called the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"Moreover, it continues to practice rigorous training such as the ""12 Years of Mountain Retreat"" and ""One Thousand Days of Peak Circumnavigation"", and as a representative holy site of Japanese Buddhism, it has been registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
"Mount Hiei, mentioned in the ""Kojiki,"" is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times, and the Hie Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot enshrines Ōyamagui no Mikoto, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno Obito Hirono, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (present-day Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (some sources say 767) during the Tenpyo Jingo era."
"At the age of 15, in 780, the eleventh year of the Hōki era, he was ordained as a monk under Gyōhyō, a priest at the Ōmi Kokubun-ji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the year 785 of the Enryaku era, he was ordained as a Buddhist monk at Todai-ji Temple in Nara."
"Young Saicho, driven by a sense of purpose, chose to forego a stable position at a major temple in Nara and instead retreated to Mount Hiei, close to his hometown, where he devoted himself to asceticism and the study of scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among all scriptures, and studied the ""Three Great Treatises on the Lotus Sutra"" (""Mystic Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", ""Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra"", and ""Mahayana Meditation"") written by Tiantai Master Zhiyi of China."
"In 788, Saicho established a small temple called Ichijo Jikan-in at the current location of the Konpon Chudo, comprising a Yakushi-do, a Monju-do, and a Sutra Repository."
"This temple, also known as Hieizan-ji, was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" after the era name, only after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu showed great faith in Saicho, and with the Emperor's patronage and the support of the Wake clan, his close advisors, Enryaku-ji Temple on Mount Hiei gradually flourished as a center for national protection, guarding the north-eastern sector of Kyoto, known as the ""demon gate."""
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a Gengakushō, a student on a short-term overseas study program."
He sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship in 804.
"Saicho, journeying to the sacred Mount Hiei, studied Tendai Buddhism and the Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the abbot Dozui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai teachings under the head priest Kōman."
"Furthermore, he studied Esoteric Buddhism under the preceptor Shunkyo at the Ryukoku-ji Temple in Koshu (Shaoxing) and Zen under the Zen master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is generally believed to be a deity who personifies the moon and rules over night, though alternative interpretations exist (see below)."
The name is also read as Tsukuyomi.
"While the Japanese Chronicles (Nihon Shoki) include a story of the slaying of the food deity, leading to a general perception of the deity as male, the chronicles themselves lack descriptions that definitively establish its gender."
"In many other cultures, the moon god is a goddess, and aggressive goddesses are also common in other mythologies. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the killing of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and they present a goddess theory."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various discrepancies in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, fleeing the underworld, purified himself and from his right eye was born Amaterasu, from his other eye,  Tsukiyomi, and from his nose, Susanoo, forming the Three Noble Children."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" provides conflicting accounts compared to the ""Kojiki,"" claiming that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, and that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. Her domain also varies, including the heavens and the sea."
"Tsukiyomi, born alongside Amaterasu who symbolizes the sun, is a recurring motif in comparative mythology, with similar ideas appearing in various myths across different cultures."
"For example, the Chinese legend of Pangu (in the ""Five Phases Chronicle"") tells of his death and his left eye becoming the sun and his right eye the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred later."
"Moreover, the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament tells of the creation of the sun and moon on the fourth day of creation, when God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and moon, and assigned them to rule over day and night, separating light from darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, too, can be seen as following the pattern of the worldwide sun-moon origin myth, in which the sun and moon are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a significant deity in Japanese mythology, alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, Tsukuyomi appears relatively little in the myths of the ""Kojiki"" and ""Nihon Shoki,"" and generally has a limited role in their narratives."
"The origin of grains is mentioned only briefly in one passage of the fifth section, eleventh volume of the ""Nihon Shoki."""
"There is also a theory that this balance is achieved by placing a god who does nothing between Amaterasu and Susanoo, two gods with contrasting personalities."
"Similar structures can also be found in the case of Amenominakanushi no Kami with Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri with Hoori (Yamayorihiko) and Hodeli (Umi-yorihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some argue that Susanoo and another deity are the same god, as their domains and stories partially overlap."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, she was born when Izanagi washed his right eye, and is known as one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi no Mikoto is commanded to ""announce the food offerings of the night,"" but he plays no further role after this."
There is also the theory that Izanami is in the land of Yomi.
"The fifth section of the Kojiki's divine age simply states that Izanagi gave birth to the moon god, whose radiance shone next to the sun, and sent him to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, in the first book of the subsequent  alternative tradition, it is said that Izanagi, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Ohirume no Mikoto, and with a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukoyomi no Mikoto."
"While there are stories where he was instructed to rule the heavens alongside Amaterasu Omikami, there are also tales where he was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the boundless sea,"" presumably stemming from the belief that the moon controls the tides.  These multiple creation myths of the three deities exist in parallel."
"In the fifth section, the eleventh book of the chronicle, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukiyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule the heavens. However, Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was later ordered by Amaterasu to meet Ukemochi no Kami, the Food Deity, in the heavens. He descended to Ukemochi no Kami's presence."
"There is a myth that the Food Deity, as an offering, vomited rice from her mouth, and the Moon God, Tsukiyomi, became enraged, calling it ""impure,"" and killed her with his sword."
"From the corpse of the food goddess arose cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice, which became the origin of grains."
Onmyoji is a title for an official who belonged to the Onmyoryo in the Ministry of Central Affairs during the Ritsuryo period in ancient Japan.
"An official position assigned to practitioners who perform divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, evolving beyond the original legal regulations to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and rituals."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has primarily referred to non-official individuals who privately practice divination, sorcery, and ritual in various regions. In contemporary usage, it defines a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyoji"" without the vowel sound being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy, which originated in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was largely completed during the Zhou dynasty, posits that all phenomena are comprised of combinations of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements. This philosophy, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendrical systems, the Book of Changes (Yi Jing), and timekeeping, was transmitted to Japan from mainland China (Han and Sui dynasties), either directly or through the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje), between the 5th and 6th centuries, specifically during the Asuka period, at the latest by 512 CE (Year 7 of Emperor Keitai's reign), when a scholar of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje, or by 554 CE (Year 15 of Emperor Kinmei's reign), when a scholar of the Book of Changes arrived."
"Although these studies initially had little impact on politics and culture, in 602, Kanroku, who is considered the pioneer of Yin-Yang philosophy in Japan, arrived from Baekje and taught the subjects to 34 selected officials, including Prince Shotoku, marking a significant influence on national governance."
"The first calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar in Japan, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilized nation, began to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements thought, and calendrical methods. Moreover, the influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements thought was clearly evident in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution and the Twelve Ranks of Cap."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (later Tang), and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China and the west coast of the Korean peninsula, where the ships often stopped, to further acquire knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines progressed in Japan, it became increasingly important to ""consider the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars, and to judge fortune and misfortune based on the principles of the Five Elements, thereby gaining insight into the future and obtaining guidance for all human affairs."" This led to a significant emphasis on Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory as a means to determine fortune and misfortune and establish behavioral norms."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of astronomical divination and deeply versed in the philosophy of Yin and Yang, established the Yin-Yang Bureau and Japan's first observatory in 676 AD (the 4th year of his reign), having even personally used a divination board (choku) during the Jinshin War."
"The term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used in 685 AD (Year 13 of Emperor Tenmu's reign), and the Yin-Yang Five Elements theory became even more prevalent. In 718 AD, the Yoro Code formally established the Onmyo-ryo, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs, with permanent positions for astronomers, Onmyo experts, calendar experts, and clock experts, alongside the Shinto Shrine's divination practices."
"Only those proficient in technical skills, responsible for technologies transmitted from the mainland, were appointed as doctors and onmyoji. These positions were typically filled by immigrants well-versed in various academic disciplines and skilled in reading classical Chinese texts. These immigrants came from various backgrounds: the former and later Han dynasties of mainland China, Sui which succeeded them as the dominant power, Goguryeo and Baekje, kingdoms that held power on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally, Silla, the initial power in the east coast of the Korean peninsula."
"Especially in the aftermath of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD, where Japan sent an expeditionary force to aid its close ally Baekje, resulting in a decisive defeat and the unification of the Korean peninsula by Silla and the demise of the Baekje dynasty, a large number of scholars and intellectuals from Baekje fled to Japan as refugees. Many of them were subsequently appointed to government positions."
"The Onmyōryō, in its early days, solely focused on divination, geomancy (similar to modern Feng Shui), celestial observation, astrology, calendar creation, determining auspicious and inauspicious days, and managing water clocks.  It exclusively relied on theoretical analysis based on Yin-Yang and Five Elements principles for astronomical observation, calendar management, and predicting the good or bad fortune of events, abstaining from any religious rituals or sorcery like those performed by the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, it played a crucial role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects in the imperial court, and in determining the good or bad fortune of locations and directions, making it vital for events like relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyōryō as a legal and administrative office and the duties of the Onmyōji.
"The Onmyōryō has, as administrative officials,"
"The office responsible for overseeing the Yin-Yang Bureau, supervising all aspects of astronomy, calendrics, wind and clouds, and auspicious signs. In the event of anomalies, they record and seal them without leaking information to the outside, and secretly report them to the Emperor (Secret Astronomical Report). By November 1st each year, the calendar doctor submits the new year's calendar (Imperial Calendar Report). They also report on divinations and geomancy findings as needed."
