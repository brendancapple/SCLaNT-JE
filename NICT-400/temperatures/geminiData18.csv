"The diary ""Toboji Kazunaga-kyo-ki"" by Sugawara Kazunaga, August 1st, Meio 3 (1494) reads, ""According to secret tradition, Ikkyu was the illegitimate son of Emperor Gokomatsu."""
"""No one in the world knows this."""
"His childhood name, according to later historical records, was Senkikumaru."
"Later in life, he was known as Zhou Jian and took the sobriquets Kuang Yun Zi, Xia Lu, and Meng Gui."
"The Buddhist name is Sōjun, which can also be written as Sōjun."

"(For the posthumous Buddhist name and dharma name, please refer to the section on ""Posthumous Buddhist name."")"
"At the age of six, he entered the Ikkyo Zokan of Ankokuji temple in Kyoto, received precepts, and was named Shukon."
"His talent for poetry was evident from an early age, with his Chinese poems ""Changmen Chuncao,"" written at 13, and ""Chunyi Suhua,"" composed at 15, gaining praise and recognition in Luoyang."
"In 1410, at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'ō Sōi, and adopted the Buddhist name Sōjun."
"At this point, while it cannot be definitively concluded whether it was due to his master's passing, Ikkyu attempts suicide."

"Hasso intended to grant a certificate of authorization, but Ikkyu declined."
"He sent Hua Sou away, laughing at him as a fool."
"Afterwards, he lived a life of poetry, satirical verse, calligraphy, painting, and wild abandon."
"In 1428, Emperor Shokō died without leaving a male heir. Emperor Go-Hanazono was then welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and ascended the throne."
It is said that Ikkyū's recommendation played a role in Emperor Gokigen's enthronement.
"From the ""Chronological Biography of Ikkyū Zenji of Tokai."""
"However, Sukuo Imaizumi argues that the enthronement of Emperor Go-Hanazono was solely due to the Shogunate's approval and that Ikkyū's recommendation played no role."
"In the sixth year of the Bunmei era (1474), following the Ōnin War, he was appointed as the abbot (47th) of Daitokuji Temple by a decree from Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado, and though he did not reside there, he dedicated himself to its revival."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace is the Imperial Palace located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"It was preserved in 1877, the 10th year of Meiji, due to the Emperor's relocation to the Tokyo Imperial Palace (former Edo Castle) during the Meiji Restoration."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been referred to as Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"The original Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo, located near the center of the city, was the Inner Palace, but due to warfare and other calamities, it fell into ruin and the Imperial Court moved to the Country Palace."
"The Tsuchimikado Higashi-dono Imperial Palace, one of the Satouchi no Rikyū, served as the residence of successive emperors of the Jimyōin-tō, who later came to be known as the Northern Court."
"The Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji-kei line of Emperors, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located in the Nijō-Tomikoji area."
"The present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the Tsuchimikado Higashi-dori Inner Palace, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Normally, attendance is available by application, but the site is open to the public in spring and fall."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and workplace of successive emperors until the Imperial Court moved to Tokyo in 1869.
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace today (21st century) is classified as ""Imperial Household Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, and is owned by the national government."
"Kyoto Imperial Palace and the Sento Imperial Palace are adjacent, and across the street to the north, on Imdegawa-dori, are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College (both located on the Imdegawa Campus)."
"The Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Dairi Palace, and the Sento Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Kyoto citizens often refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, simply as ""Gosho."""
"While unlike foreign castles, the walls surrounding the Imperial Palace are not very high, there is a theory that this reflects a different sense of familiarity between the common people and the rulers (such as the Emperor and the Imperial Family) in the East and West."
"For example, the fact that no incident like the storming of the Palace of Versailles, the seat of power (the King) during the French Revolution, has occurred in Japan, is one of the reasons for this consideration."
"The initial imperial palace of Heian-kyō was located considerably west of the present-day Kyoto Imperial Palace, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection near the Nishi-Nihon Railway's Nijō Station."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the satsuki-no-uchi, known as the Tsuchimikado Higashi no Toin-dono, and was first used by Emperor Kōgon of the Northern Court in 1331."
"The Imperial Palace that stood here was rebuilt eight times during the Edo period (six of which were due to fires), and the current structure, known as the Ansei Imperial Palace, was rebuilt in 1855 during the Ansei era in the Heian style."
"In 1877, during Emperor Meiji's visit to Kyoto after having resided in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, he lamented the dilapidation of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had occurred in just ten years since his departure from the capital. He ordered the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its historical appearance."
"Major buildings include Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Gokumonjo, Tsunegoten, Kojun, Osuzumi-sho, and the Empress' Palace."
"The Enthronement Ceremony has traditionally been held in the Shishinden Hall of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Even after the Meiji Restoration when the Emperor moved to Tokyo, the Imperial Household Law of 1889 stipulated that the Enthronement Ceremony and the Daijosai (Great Rice Harvest Festival) be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taishō and Emperor Shōwa performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, the current Imperial Household Law, enacted after World War II, does not specify any particular location for the ceremony, and in 1990, the enthronement ceremony for the current Emperor took place in the Imperial Palace in Tokyo for the first time in history."
"The Takamikura, the ceremonial throne where the Emperor sits during his enthronement, is located in the Shishinden Palace in Kyoto Imperial Palace, thus for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, the ""Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to ""Shishinden no Gi""), it was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"Plain wooden, gable roof, cypress bark shingled, four-legged gate with a 1-ken bay."
"The gates are opened only for special events, such as visits by the Emperor, dignitaries, state guests, or public openings."
"The two flanking earthen walls each feature five horizontal lines, signifying the highest level of formality for a wall."
"Enter this gate and pass through the vermilion-tiled Jo-mei gate, and the Shi-shin-den will be directly in front of you."
"Gagaku is a traditional music of Japan, China, Korea, and Vietnam."
"Below, focusing primarily on Japanese gagaku (Important Intangible Cultural Property) as it is passed down in the Shikibu-sho Gakubu of the Imperial Household Agency."
"The original meaning of gagaku is ""elegant and refined music and dance,"" the opposite of ""folk music."""
"According to the definition by the Department of Music of the Imperial Household Agency within Japan, the term refers to all music performed by the Department except Western music."
Much of it is inherited as court music in the form of instrumental pieces.
It is the oldest style of traditional music in the world that is still performed in large ensemble formations.
"However, as a true ensemble form of Gagaku, it was interrupted for over a hundred years after the Onin War, until the Tokugawa Shogunate brought together descendants of musicians (Gakke) and reorganized it. Therefore, it is questionable how much it has inherited from the Heian period."
"It is highly likely that this rendition, using a hichiriki score written in katakana, faithfully replicates the singing style of the pre-16th century, including the pronunciation of the ""h"" sounds as ""fa fi fu fe fo""."
"Music notation resembling the ""Raku Biwa"" scores, written in kanji characters, shares many similarities with the Biwa scores discovered in Dunhuang, China. Furthermore, it is evident that these notations preserve ancient musical styles inherited from the continent."
"The most important historical source is the ""Tai Gensho,"" written by Toyohara Noritake (1450-1512) out of concern that records of gagaku [Japanese court music] and other traditions would be lost due to the Ōnin War."
"Tōshū, from the Shō music school, compiled a record focused on Shō-centric Gagaku and Bugaku, offering valuable documentation of Gagaku in ancient times."
"It is based on ritual music that originated in China, Korea, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, Gagaku was music performed for ceremonies."
"However, it is said that Tang music, which is performed in Japanese gagaku today and is believed to have originated in China, is based on Yan music, music that was played at banquets in the Tang Dynasty."
"Even as categories of music, names like Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (Champa music) with their international flavors are passed down, suggesting elements of ancient Japanese music from before the introduction of music from the continent."
"Prior to modern times, the Tennoji Gakujo of Shitennō-ji Temple (Osaka), the Ōuchi Gakujo of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakujo of Kasuga Taisha Shrine (Nara) were considered the three major musical centers."
"These musical institutions were later brought to Tokyo during the modern period, forming the basis of today's Imperial Household Agency's music groups, while their respective traditions continue in their original locations."
"It has also been mutually influenced by folk songs and Buddhist chants, resulting in the development of a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, about 100 pieces of music are preserved by the Shikibu-sho Gaku-bu of the Imperial Household Agency."
The lyrics refer to s-country style song and dance.
Things transmitted from outside Japan (some view this alone as gagaku).
"Left-hand Dance, Tang Music ... Chinese, Indian, and Lin-yi (South Vietnamese) influences."
"Right-Hand Dance, Koryo-gak... Korean, Balhae (Northeastern China) lineage."
This includes songs made in Japan (Hon-gagaku) that imitate the above style.
Songs created in the Heian period (utaimono)
Lyrics refer to a ballad.
"※ Sometimes ""Koku-fu Kabuki"" and ""Yōmono"" are collectively referred to as ancient songs."
Emperor Kanmu (737 - 806) was the 50th emperor of Japan.
"Emperor Kanmu was born in 737, the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin)."
"The *Nihon Shoki* records that Mother Takano's new cap was descended from the Baekje royal family, tracing their ancestry back to King Mu of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomo, through her influence, produced Emperor Antoku (later Emperor Heizei) and Prince Kamo (later Emperor Saga), while Lady Fujiwara no Tabiko, her consort, gave birth to Otomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, Shirokami no Ō, ascended to the throne, he was not considered a candidate for the Crown Prince as his mother, Takanono Shin-kasa, was from a low-ranking naturalized clan, the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for a career as an official, serving as Chamberlain, Head of the University, and Minister of Central Affairs."
"However, he was suddenly made Crown Prince on January 2, 773, after his half-brother, the former Crown Prince, Prince Oto, and his mother, Empress Inoue, were abruptly deposed in a political struggle involving the Fujiwara clan."
"Fearing the growing influence of Nara Buddhist temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"First, in 784, they built Nagaoka-kyo, but then, in 794, they built Heian-kyo anew."
He then sent an army led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as the Seiitaishogun to conquer the Tohoku region and subjugate the Ezo people.
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara Tsuyoshi of the Fujiwara clan for the hardship his military activities and construction projects caused the peasants."
He is said to have conceived the compilation of the Chronicles of Japan.
It was under the reign of Emperor Kanmu that Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new momentum to Japanese Buddhism.
"The reign began with the unnatural deaths of Imperial Princess Inoue and Imperial Princess Taga, and was further marked by the tragic exile of Emperor Kanmu's younger brother, Prince Sawara, in 785. Accused of plotting the assassination of Fujiwara no Tanetsugu, Prince Sawara was banished and died in exile, casting a dark shadow over the early years of the emperor's rule."
"Fearing the vengeful spirit, on July 19, 800, Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sudo, Empress Inoue's tomb was designated as an imperial mausoleum, and her title of empress was reinstated."
"While known as the patron of Saicho and Kūkai, he also oppressed the so-called ""Six Schools of Nara"", confiscating their estates and applying pressure, because the existing Buddhist schools had become too entangled with the government and wielded excessive power."
"The harem was also known for its chaos, and this became a breeding ground for the later ""Yakuzi Incident."""
"Died on March 17th, 806."
"He was given the posthumous title, Emperor Yayoi no Mikoto, with the Japanese-style honorific."
"He was posthumously given the Chinese-style posthumous title, Emperor Kanmu."
He was also called Kashiwabara Emperor and Tenkokuoshihaberi no Miya Kashiwabara Emperor.
"The mausoleum is said to be at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto."
"He had insisted on being buried in Utanō after his death, but due to divination, he was ultimately interred at Kashiwabara no Misasagi in Fushimi."
"During the Meiji era, Emperor Kanmu was enshrined in Heian-jingu as the first emperor of Heian-kyo."
"All emperors are also enshrined in the Imperial Spirit Hall, one of the three palaces within the Imperial Palace."
"On December 18, 2001, in a customary press conference prior to his birthday, Emperor Akihito, in a portion of his comments concerning Japan's co-hosting of the upcoming FIFA World Cup the following year, said, ""I feel a connection to the Republic of Korea based on the record in the Shoku Nihongi stating that Emperor Kanmu's mother was a descendant of King Mu of Baekje."""
"While this statement did not receive much attention in Japan, it was widely reported and became a major talking point in South Korean media."
"Some reports contained a significant exaggeration of claims like ""the Imperial Family is descended from Korean bloodlines"" and ""the Imperial Family originates from Baekje."""
"The Ōtani family is a house name descended from Kakuei, son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotsuna."
"Hirotsu Hiromitsu was a low-ranking court noble in Kyoto, while Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect, and succeeded as the hereditary head priest (Hojo) of the Honzanji temple, the dominant branch of Jodo Shinshu."
"Both the chief priests of the Jodo Shinshu Hongwanji-ha ( Nishi Hongwanji ) and the Jodo Shinshu Otani-ha ( Shinmonkyo ), which split from the former in 1602, adopted surnames during the Meiji period."
"The origin of the Otani surname stems from the location of Shinran's temple, established in Ootani, north of the Chion-in Temple in Kyoto's Higashiyama district."
"Though the Hongan-ji Temple during the Sengoku period (Japan) was considered a force equal to the Warring States Lords due to the expansion of the Ikko-ikki movement, it is often counted as one of the Warring States Lords. The chief priest's Dharma name (Jodo Shinshu) and personal name often included ""Hongan-ji"", such as ""Hongan-ji Kannon"" and ""Hongan-ji Kosuke."" This is purely for convenience of designation. The Hongan-ji chief priests did not use Hongan-ji as their family name or surname, nor did a ""Hongan-ji"" family ever exist."
"Jaku-shin-ni was present when Shinran passed away in 1262, and in 1272 built a hall to house his remains in O-tani, near her home in Kyoto's eastern hills."
"Ootani-do, as a mausoleum for Shinran, became the revered Ootani Temple for followers of Jodo Shinshu, with Kakuei, the eldest son of Kakushin-ni, appointed as its caretaker."
"However, the Ōtani temple, attracting pilgrims and donations from various provinces, later saw a dispute over the absentee position between Kakunyo, the son of Kakkei, and  Yuisen, Kakkei's half-brother.  Kakunyo emerged victorious, securing the hereditary nature of the absentee position for his lineage."
"In 1312, Kakunyo transformed the ancestral temple into a Buddhist temple, marking the birth of the Otani Hongan-ji."
"Since then, the Hongwanji Temple, inherited by the descendants of Kakunyo, fostered the formation of a religious sect.  During the Muromachi period, under the fifth generation leader, Shakanyo, the sect expanded into the Hokuriku region.  By the time of the seventh generation leader, Jonyo, Hongwanji temples had been established in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, and Omi provinces."
"However, compared to other Jodo Shinshu lineages that had been working on establishing their sects since the death of Shinran, the formation of the Honganji sect lagged significantly.  During the early Muromachi period, Honganji was considered a subsidiary temple of the Shoren-in, and the Otani family, due to their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), served as vassals of the Kujo family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the Hongan-ji sect, led by its eighth chief priest Rennyo, spread throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the Otani Hongan-ji was destroyed and the chief priest was forced to relocate, first to Yoshizaki in Echizen Province and later to Yamashina, a suburb of Kyoto."
"Against the backdrop of the expanding religious influence of Rennyo during his era, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, driving out the Togashi, the guardians of Kaga, and resulting in a situation known as ""a country ruled by peasants."""
"For nearly a hundred years, until 1580, the land was effectively ruled by the Ikkō sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the turmoil of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, leveraging its organizational strength that extended from small farmers to the samurai class, including local samurai and local lords, saw its activities intensify throughout Japan. However, the Yamashina Honganji Temple was ravaged by war in the Tenbun-Hoka War in 1532. The 10th head priest, Shonyo, then relocated to the Ishiyama Goho, founded by Rennyo in Nishinari County, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), establishing it as the Ishiyama Honganji Temple."
The Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple was located on the crest of a hill at the northern edge of the Uemachi Plateau.
"It controlled Osaka, a strategic hub for river transport at the mouth of the Yodo River."
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shoku was able to solidify the temple's power base by fostering close relationships with various lords, the shogunate, and the Imperial Court."
"On the other hand, towards the end of the Shōko era, some within the Honganji sect, especially in regions like Hokuriku, began to break away from Honganji's control and pursue their own path."
"During the time of Shonyo's son, the 11th head priest Kannon, the Honganji Buddhist sect had effectively become an independent feudal power. Their advance into the Kinai region brought them into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who aimed to unify the area by seizing territorial power from religious factions."
"The Ishiyama War, a ten-year conflict between the Honganji Temple and the Oda clan that lasted from 1570, saw the Honganji Temple gain the upper hand through a combination of Kannon and his followers holding out in the fortified Ishiyama Honganji Temple and the widespread resistance of the Honganji Temple's followers against Oda forces across the land, thus greatly hindering Nobunaga's progress."
"However, in 1574, the Ganjoji Temple in Nagashima, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko-ikki, who had reclaimed Echizen from the Oda clan, was crushed, among other local resistances that were suppressed. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Honganji Temple, was defeated by the Oda navy at the Battle of Kizu River, and outside the Honganji Temple, they suffered repeated defeats."
"Despite maintaining its strength by gathering support from groups like the Saiga Shu, the Honganji Temple gradually became isolated amongst its enemies. In 1580, it finally surrendered to Nobunaga, who had secured an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and left Ishiyama Honganji Temple. The Honganji Temple as a land-owning power thus ceased to exist."
"At this time, Kyonyo's eldest son, Kyo-nyo, argued for continued resistance against Kyonyo's wishes, leading to a rift between them. When Kyonyo died in 1593, his third son, Jun-nyo, was made his successor."
"From this point forward, the Hongan-ji temple began to split over the succession to the head priest. In 1602, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Junyo a separate temple site from that of Kyo-nyo, creating the separate East Hongan-ji temple."
"At this time, many followers from Junyo's sect, which became Nishi Honganji, moved to Kyoju's sect, which became Higashi Honganji, and the Honganji split into East and West."
"Originally, the heads of the two great Otani families, tracing their lineage to both Shinran, a son of the court noble Hino Ari-noru, and Hino Hirotsuna (father of Kakunyo), followed the custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles.  Furthermore, they consistently intermarried with court families, further solidifying their nobility through their maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is a city located near the border of Kyoto Prefecture with Osaka and Nara Prefectures in southern Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyoutanabe City is located in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, bordering Yawata City, Jōyō City, Ide-cho of Tsuzuki District, Seika-cho of Soraku District, Hirakata City of Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City of Nara Prefecture, and is situated at the center of a triangular area connecting three prefectures."
"Bounded by the Kizu River, which flows north-south along the city's east side, and the Ikoma Mountains on the west, the city's center is crossed by the West Japan Railway Company's Katamachi Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line."
"Kyoto City, Nara City, and Osaka City are largely considered bedroom communities."
"April 1, 1997, municipal status implemented, formerly Tsuzuki District, Tanabe Town."
"It was born as the 12th city in Kyoto Prefecture, the first in 20 years since Yawata City, and the 669th city in Japan."
"To avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, the town of Tanabe, Tsuzuki District, Kyoto Prefecture, was designated as ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the addition of ""Kyoto"" (京), and the designation of the town as a city (municipal implementation) and the change of the city's name to ""Kyoto Prefecture Kyotanabe City"" were both carried out on the same day."
"Moreover, the new city name was selected through a public competition."
"Tea (Uji tea) cultivation thrives, and Gyokuro is a specialty product."
Companies headquartered in Kyotanabe City
"Keihan Uji Bus (began operation in the eastern part of the city on November 10, 2007)."

The seated statue of Ikkyū Zenji and the designated scenic garden are Important Cultural Properties.
"The city has three main stations: Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyama-te Station."
"Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station and JR Kyoutanabe Station serve as the central hubs of Kyoutanabe city, while Matsuiyama-te Station functions as the center of the K-Town East Rosetown area."
"Moreover, ordinary trains of the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line run through to Kintetsu Shin-Tanabe Station."
JR Kyotanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city's name around the time the city was established.
This is similar to the cases of Nishio-Hi and Higashi-Hi stations on the Hankyu Kyoto Line.
"Kii-Tanabe Station (on the Kisei Line) is located in Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, but the ""Kii"" part, an old province name of Wakayama, is used in the station's name to avoid duplication with other stations in the same West Japan Railway Company network."

Musashi Province was once one of the provinces of Japan's traditional administrative divisions.
"It corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in present-day Saitama and Tokyo prefectures, excluding islands, and the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of present-day Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal parts of Yokohama City)."
"Rank in the Engi-shiki, provincial governor rank classification, remote province."
Heian-kyō was the capital of Japan established by Emperor Kanmu in 794 AD (the 13th year of the Enryaku era).
"Heian-kyo, built on the border of the Kazuragi and Atago districts of Yamashiro Province, corresponding to the central area of present-day Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture, was a rectangular city 4.5 km east to west and 5.2 km north to south."
"A grand palace was to be established in the center of the northern edge of the capital, with the Suzaku Avenue extending from it towards the heart of the city, dividing it into left and right wards (the east being the left ward and the west being the right)."
"The floor plan basically follows Heijō-kyō, modeled after Changan of the Sui and Tang dynasties."
There were no walls.
"There is also a theory that the selection of this location was based on the concept of ""Four Symbols in Harmony"", derived from Feng Shui, which originated in China."
The Heian-kyo's area was smaller than present-day Kyoto city.
"The northernmost major street, Ichijo Oji, is located on Ichijo Street, midway between the present-day Imadegawa-dori and Marutamachi-dori."
The Ninth Avenue at the southern limit is today's Kyōto Station's Kujō Street.
"Tokyo's easternmost limit, the Grand Avenue, corresponds to present-day Teramachi Street."
"The estimated location of Nishikyokudai-ro, the western limit, is a line running north-south connecting Saikyo-ku Station on the West Japan Railway Company's San'in Main Line (Kyoto Prefecture) and Saikyo-ku Station on the Hankyu Railway's Hankyu Kyoto Main Line."
"Kyonae was divided into ""machi"" (blocks), each 40 jo (about 120 meters) square, by a grid of major and minor roads running north-south, east-west."
"A row of four towns aligned east to west, excluding the two rows on the northern edge, is called a ""条"", while four columns aligned north to south are called a ""坊""."
The 16 towns belonging to the same ward were each numbered.
"This led to each town being called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Jūyonchō""."
"Roads, even small paths, were 4 zhang (about 12 meters) wide, while major roads were 8 zhang (about 24 meters) or wider."
Existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places.
It reached a width of 28 zhang (approximately 84 meters) at the Suzaku Avenue.
"Furthermore, rivers (Horikawa (Kyoto Prefecture) and Nishi-horikawa) flowed in parallel with Horikawa-koji and Nishi-horikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Nagaoka-kyo in Yamashiro Province in 784.
"This is said to have been intended to move the capital from Yamato Province, the center of power for the nobility and temples that supported the Tenmu dynasty, to establish a new capital for the Tenchi dynasty."
"However, just ten years later in 794, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital again to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, establishing Heian-kyō."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents, including the assassination of Fujiwara no Tane継 in Nagaoka-kyō, the subsequent demotion of Prince  Sawara, and the slow progress of Nagaoka-kyō's construction."
The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have begun with the Imperial Palace (Daidairi) followed by the development of the city itself.
"The right bank of Kyoto was a wetland shaped by the Katsura River (part of the Yodo River system), thus remaining undeveloped into the 9th century."
"Even by the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become a mere formality, the capital was in decline and land within its boundaries, where farming was strictly forbidden, was even being converted to agricultural use."
"The residences of the nobility were established in the Sakyo district, except for the northern part of the Ukyo district, which was located close to the Daidairi."
"The Nihon Kōki is an official historical text compiled in the early Heian period, the third of the Six National Histories, following the Shoku Nihongi."
"Completed in the 7th year of Jōwa (840), it records the 42 years from the 11th year of Enryaku (792) to the 10th year of Tenchō (833)."
Editors include Fujiwara Tsugitsugu and others.
"According to the preface, in the year 819 (弘仁 10), Emperor Saga commissioned Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Ototsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Ryosen no Yasuyoshi to compile the work."
"After the deaths of three people, excluding Prince Osushi, the project remained unfinished. Later, Emperor Junwa issued an edict appointing Kiyokazu Kiyohara, Naoyoshi-ou, Yoshino Fujiwara, Minamori Ono, Imatsuki Saka no Ue, and Kiyota Shimada to continue it."
"During the reign of Emperor Ninmyo, a further decree was issued, ordering Fujiwara Tsugu, Minamoto Tsune, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikatori to carry it out."
"After further work, including the additions of Furuko-niwa and Yamada-koshi, the project was finally completed and reported on December 9th of the seventh year of the Jowa era (January 5th, 841)."
"It was藤原緒嗣 alone who dedicated his life to the project, spanning 21 years and three emperors, from its inception to completion."
"Continuing after the *Nihon Shoki*, it chronicles the reigns of Emperor Heizei, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna, beginning midway through Emperor Kanmu's reign."
"Although originally a complete set of 40 volumes in the early 15th century, it later became dispersed.  Yukinori Inayaman, a disciple of Hori-i Oriku, discovered ten volumes of a copy at the Sanjōnishi residence, although some sources claim it was the revised edition by Norikazu Yanagihara.  This discovery marked the first publication of the work."
"The existing volumes are 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kanmu), 14, 17 (Heijo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), a total of 10 volumes, with the reign of Emperor Junna entirely missing."
"Extracts from the ""Nihon Kiryaku"" (a condensed version of the ""Six National Histories"") and citations from the ""Ruiju Kokushi"" (a classified compilation of the ""Six National Histories"") can be used to partially reconstruct the original text."
"There are ""Nihon Ichi Shi"" and ""Nihon Goki Ibun"", which collect various anecdotes. Based on these, the following materials are published by Shueisha's annotated Japanese historical materials and Kodansha Gakujutsu Bunko."
It is said that the content most reflects Fujiwara Otsugu's opinion.
"The inclusion of short biographies (kōden) in the death notices of emperors and court officials, following the precedent set by the ""Shoku Nihongi,"" was a practice continued in subsequent historical works."
"However, the account of the Emperor's death in this book avoids both one-sided, official praise and condemnation, offering a number of interesting descriptions that blend unique criticisms and observations.  This makes it stand out from the other six national histories, as it maintains a spirit of critical thinking."
"It is also known that among the six national histories, it included more waka poems than preceding and succeeding histories."
Sei Shōnagon (circa 966 – circa 1025) was a female writer and poet of the Heian period.
"Some say her real name was Nagiko Kiyohara, but her true identity remains unknown."
"The late daughter of Kiyohara Motosuke (908 - 990), one of the five great poets of the ""Nashiko"" group."
"There is an ancient tradition that identifies ""Higaki no Ona"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu"" as the mother, but this is simply a preposterous claim."
"His great-grandfather (some say his grandfather) was Kiyohara no Fukayabu, a prominent poet of the Kokin Wakashū anthology."
"There are siblings, including Akechi Narinaga, Tai Zaishokan, Kakuju, the court priest of the Kashoin, and a woman who became the wife of Fujiwara no Yoshinobu (brother of Fujiwara no Michinaga's mother)."
"Seishōnagon is a court lady's name, with ""Sei"" derived from the surname Kiyohara and ""Shōnagon"" from the title of a relative."
"The real name is unknown, although some (including ""The Pillow Book"" manuscript) say it was ""Nagiko."" This claim is dubious."
"Counted among the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets, her small collection of 42 poems, ""The Collected Poems of Sei Shōnagon"" (the number of poems varies depending on the manuscript; the most widely circulated version has 31 poems), has been passed down."
"Included in the following Imperial Anthologies, starting with the ""Shūi Wakashū,"" are 14 poems."
Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the 15th and last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: 1568-1588).
"His father was the 12th shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Her mother was Keishu-in, daughter of Konoe  Takamichi."
"The 13th Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was his older brother."
"Though initially a Buddhist monk, he escaped Kyoto with the assistance of Hosokawa Yuzai and other vassals after Yoshiaki was assassinated by Matsu permanent Hidehisa."
"He then ascended to the throne as the 15th Shogun, backed by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province."
"He would eventually clash with Nobunaga, forging an alliance with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage to form a network aimed at besieging Nobunaga."
"While he briefly cornered Nobunaga, the Shogun was ultimately driven from Kyoto by him, effectively bringing an end to the Muromachi Shogunate."
He spent his remaining years with the assistance of Mōri Terumoto and later Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
"Born November 13th, Tenbun 6 (1537), second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"As his elder brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was heir, he entered the Buddhist priesthood (at the Ichijoin Temple of Kofuku-ji) at a young age, becoming the adopted son of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamitsu, and taking the name Kakkei."
He later rose to the position of Gon-Shōsōzu at Kōfuku-ji Temple.
"In 1565, during the Eiroku Incident, the 13th shogun, Yoshihisa, was assassinated by Matsuura Nagahisa and the Miyoshi Trio, and his brother, Ashikaga Shukatsu, who was the abbot of Rokuon-in, was also killed."
"At this time, Yoshiteru was also captured by Nagahisa Matsunaga and others and imprisoned in the Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Nagahisa and his men, fearing that they would make the Kofukuji Temple their enemy if they killed Joken, who was the shogun's brother and had been promised the position of chief priest of the temple in the future, decided to only imprison him.)"
"However, he escaped with the help of retainers such as Hosokawa Yūsai and Wada Koremasa, and on February 17, 1566, he renounced his monastic vows and took the name Yoshiteru."
"Books documenting Yoshiaki's life mention that he was referred to by other titles, such as ""Buke Gosho""."
"He was called ""the impoverished shogun"" because he was driven from the capital and attacked by night bandits."
"On April 21st, he was secretly conferred the rank of Jushi-no-ge and appointed to the post of Sama no kami."
"While there are dissenting opinions regarding the exact date of his appointment, Yamaoka Tokitsugu's ""Tokitsugu-kyoki"" records that in February of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), on the very day of the declaration of Yoshiaki's rival, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, as Shogun, Tokitsugu, who was the messenger for the declaration, was perplexed by the arrival of Yoshiaki's messenger to his residence to request mediation in Yoshiaki's promotion to the rank of Jushi no ge.  This clearly shows that Yoshiaki had been appointed prior to this."
"Having fled Kyoto, Yoshitsugu first sought refuge with the Rokkaku Yoshikata and Yoshiharu father and son in Omi Province. However, when Yoshiharu secretly entered into an alliance with the Miyoshi Three, Yoshitsugu escaped to Wakasa Province in August to live with his sister's husband, Takeda Yoshitaka."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan lacked the power to ascend to Kyoto due to internal power struggles and disputes among their senior vassals. In September, they fled to Asakura Yoshikage in Echizen Province and sought his assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Asakura Yoshikage already had Ashikaga Tsugutomo, a member of the Ashikaga Shogunate lineage, and was not eager to ascend to Kyoto with the newly-resigned Ashikaga Yoshiaki. Therefore, the ascent to Kyoto did not materialize."
"The role of cap-placing was performed by Asakura Yoshikage (note, there is no historical documentation that Yoshiaki formally came of age at this time, making it far too late for him to do so according to the standards of the time)."
"Later, with the help of Mitsuhide Akechi, a high-ranking official of the Asakura clan, he moved to Mino Province under the patronage of Oda Nobunaga."
"In September, 1568, he ascended to the capital, supported by Oda Nobunaga."
He was appointed the 15th Shogun by the Imperial Court on October 18th.
"He was simultaneously promoted to the rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed to the posts of Councilor and Lieutenant General of the Left Division of the Imperial Guard."
JR Kyoto Line is the nickname for the section of the East Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"It runs parallel to Hankyu Railway's Hankyu Kyoto Line (Kyoto Line) for almost the entire route, and there is also a Kintetsu Kyoto Line operated by Kintetsu, which both connect to Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station, so it uses ""JR"" in its nickname to avoid confusion."
"The line color is blue (■), and along with the JR Kobe Line, it is positioned as a main line of the company, so the corporate color itself is used as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodogawa River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto and Osaka in 42.8 km, with the fastest journey time being 28 minutes (maximum speed of 130 km/h)."
All sections are quad-track with quad-track direction-specific (outer and inner tracks).
"All JR Kyoto Line stations accept J-Thru ICOCA, as well as JR East's Suica, JR Central's TOICA, and Surutto KANSAI's PiTaPa."
The entire line uses the Sanyo Line operation management system.
It operates in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and the Biwako Line.
"The line offers a range of services including rapid express, express, and local trains (京阪神緩行線) connecting JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line. It also serves as a terminal for limited express trains to Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and San-in region."
"Also, nearly half of all local trains run through to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR privatization, the number of express trains in this section dramatically increased as Kyushu-bound sleeper express trains originating from Shin-Osaka, South-bound express trains originating from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" service to the San'in region, which began after the opening of the Chizu Express Line, all began operating through to Kyoto."
"In particular, the Haruka express, which began operation concurrently with the opening of Kansai International Airport, saw all its trains operating regularly to Kyoto just one year later, turning the Shin-Osaka - Kyoto route into a “express highway” with about four trains per hour, including the Hokuriku-bound limited express ""Thunderbird."""
"However, all sleeper trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were abolished on the March 15, 2008 timetable revision."
"Downward express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" that enter the Hanwa Line via the Osaka Loop Line from Shin-Osaka enter Shin-Osaka via a freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) through the Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, the journey time is slightly longer than the express and rapid trains that run on the outer lines of the same section, and sometimes two express trains enter Shin-Osaka Station at the same time."
"The line between Kyoto and Osaka is largely straight, enabling speeds of 130km/h on most of the outer track, except for a few curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of 120km/h, but express trains never run on it (except for empty trains or special trains)."
The following express trains operate on this section.
"In addition, there are also freight trains such as the ""Hamakaze"", ""Tamba"", and ""Hokkinoki"" that operate on this section for shunting operations to and from Mukomachi (Kyoto Comprehensive Depot)."
"Also, the ""Thunderbird"", ""Raicho"", and ""Kitaguni"" turnaround trains between Mukomachi and Osaka use the Hokubu Freight Line."
"When an Osaka-bound train is stored at Kyoto General Depot, it travels through Osaka Station in the downhill direction, passes Tsukamoto Station, enters the Kita Osaka Freight Line from the west, and merges with the JR Kyoto Line (outer line). (The departure route is the reverse of this.)"
"Therefore, the order of the cars in a train is reversed when it's entering or leaving the station."
"The New Rapid service operates directly from the JR Kobe Line Himeji, Sanyo Main Line Amagasaki, Kami-gori, Ako Line Banshu-Ako direction, through the JR Kyoto Line, to the Biwako Line Nagahama, Hokuriku Main Line Omi-shiotsu, and Tsuruga stations."
"From midday to evening, trains run every 15 minutes, with one midday service going to the Kusatsu Line and the remaining three running directly to the Biwako Line."
All four trains run through to the Biwako Line at night.
All trains are operated with 8 or 12 cars using JR West 223 Series 1000 and 2000 Series trains.
"The Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway (Kyoto Jukan Expressway), extending approximately 100 km, is a high-standard expressway (National Route 478) connecting Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture to Miyazu City in the same prefecture."
"Running longitudinally through Kyoto Prefecture, which is long from north to south, it strengthens the linkage between the northern and southern parts of the prefecture, promotes regional revitalization, and serves as a southern outer ring road for the Kyoto metropolitan area, where the high-standard road network is fragile."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture calls this road ""the backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three sections are open, the starting point, the central part, and the end point. The starting point section opened under the name ""Kei-shi Bypass,"" not ""Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."""
"Also, it's common to refer to the Kyoto Tanba Road simply as the Kyoto Longitudinal Expressway."
"The main line portion of the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC does not end here, but will be extended as part of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway, a regional high-standard highway, to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Expressway and the San'in Expressway."
"However, the section from Kuze-Yodo IC to Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a highway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage by small motorcycles is not allowed."
"Therefore, ETC installation works are currently underway at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Ooe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding 2.5m in width are prohibited from passing.
"Toll Road Sections (Ayabe-Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefecture Road Corporation, other sections are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"Currently, there is no exit between Ayabe Kita-Honsen Toll Booth (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, making it impossible to drive on the toll-free section only."
"The Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation is scheduled to manage the Kyotanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji section, which is planned to open in summer or autumn of 2008. As a result, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT section will also be managed by the corporation, making the currently free section subject to tolls."
"Accordingly, the current Ayabe Kita Main Toll Plaza (Ayabe JCT) will be removed and a new Ayabe Ankokuji Toll Plaza will be constructed."
The current Ayabe-Ankokuji IC has no toll booth. This will make the Ayabe-Miyazu Road toll-free on its main line.
The current Ayabe Kita-Honsen toll plaza (Ayabe JCT) is built like a temporary prefabricated structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanabe Wachi IC project is currently underway by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, with an expected opening date in fiscal year 2014. However, the post-opening management structure remains unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The Route 9 Old Sakasaka Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC - Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC - Chiyodagawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"May 6, 1993: The section of road from Kutsukake IC to Chiyodagawa IC was renumbered from National Route 9 to National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC - Chiyogawa IC opened as a general toll road."
"March 8, 1998: Connection to the Maizuru Expressway (now the Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) was established with the opening of the Ayabe Junction to Maizuru Ooe Interchange (two-lane, divided highway)."
"October 1, 2005: The four public corporations related to roads were privatized, with their assets transferred to the Japan Highway Public Corporation and their management to West Nippon Expressway Company."
Sections with a background color of ■ in the IC Number column indicate roads that are in service.
"Also, areas with a  ■ background in the Facility Name column indicate that the facility is not in use or is incomplete."
The name of the unopened section is provisional.
Muji is no BS.
(Number) is the number of another line.
<number> is the appointment number.
"Enryakuji Temple is located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, Japan, encompassing the entirety of Mount Hiei, which reaches an elevation of 848 meters."
"More often referred to as Mount Hiei, rather than its formal name, Enryaku-ji Temple. It is also frequently called Eizan."
"It was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto), and was also called Hokurei."
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, founded by the early Heian period monk Saicho (767-822)."
"The head priest (chief abbot), called the Tendai Zasù, oversees the affiliated temples."
"Since its founding by Saicho, it has been a central hub of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya Kongōbu-ji Temple."
"Besides the teachings of Tendai Buddhism, it practiced esoteric Buddhism, Zen (shikan), and Nembutsu, presenting itself as a comprehensive Buddhist university. In the Heian period, it gained the respect of the Imperial family and aristocracy, achieving significant influence."
"Especially, esoteric Buddhist rituals and prayers, known as *kaji-kito*, gained wide support among the Heian nobility, with the esoteric Buddhism of Toji Temple, belonging to the Shingon sect, called *Tomitsu*, competing with the esoteric Buddhism of Enryakuji Temple, called *Daimitsu*."
"Enryaku-ji refers to the collective name for the various halls and pagodas of the three towers and sixteen valleys scattered throughout the grounds of Mount Hiei, extending from the summit down to the eastern foot."
"Its origin lies in the founding of a humble retreat, Ichijo Zokan-in, by Saicho in the year 788 (延暦 7)."
"It was not until 824, in the 14th year of the弘仁 era, after Saicho's death, that the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"", which took its name from the era of its founding, was permitted."
"Enryakuji Temple, which has produced countless renowned monks and laid the foundation for Japanese Tendai Buddhism, is also known as the ""Mother Mountain of Japanese Buddhism."" Many founders of new Buddhist schools and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history, including Ennin, Enchin, Ryonin the founder of Yuzu Nenbutsu, Honen the founder of Jodo sect, Shinran the founder of Jodo Shinshu, Eisai the founder of Rinzai sect, Dogen the founder of Soto sect, and Nichiren the founder of Nichiren sect, practiced at Mt. Hiei in their youth."
Mount Hiei appears frequently in literary works.
"Moreover, rigorous training practices like the ""12-year Mountain Retreat"" and ""1,000-Day Peak Pilgrimage"" continue to this day, and the site is recognized as a significant center of Japanese Buddhism, even being registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain mentioned in the ""Kojiki,"" Japan's oldest chronicle, suggesting its significance as a site of mountain worship since ancient times. The Hie Shrine, located in Sakamoto on the mountain's eastern foot, enshrines Ooyamagui, the tutelary deity of Mount Hiei."
"Saicho, whose secular name was Mitsuno-obuhiro-no, was born in Shiga County, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture) in 766 (some say 767)."
"At age 15, in the year 780, the eleventh year of the Hōki era, he was ordained as a monk under the guidance of Gyōhyō, a monk of the Ōmi Provincial Temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of twenty, in 785, he was ordained a monk at Todai-ji Temple in Nara."
"Young Saicho, driven by his convictions, chose not to seek a secure position at the great temples of Nara. Instead, he retreated to Mount Hiei, near his homeland, where he devoted himself to rigorous training and the study of Buddhist scriptures."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra the highest among all scriptures and studied the ""Three Major Works of the Lotus Sutra"" (the ""Mystic Meaning of the Lotus Sutra"", the ""Words of the Lotus Sutra"", and the ""Great Concentration and Insight""), written by the Tiantai master Zhiyi in China."
"In 788, Saicho founded a small temple called Ichijō Jikan-in on the site of the present-day Konponchūdō, consisting of a Yakushi Hall, a Manjushri Hall, and a Sutra Repository."
"This temple, also known as Hieizan-ji Temple, was granted the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" after the era name, only after the death of Saicho, in the 14th year of the Jōnin era (824)."
"During his reign, Emperor Kanmu became a devout follower of Saicho. With the Emperor's support and that of the Wake clan, his close advisors, Enryaku-ji Temple gradually prospered as a national protectorate, guarding the demon gate (northeast) of Kyoto."
"In 802, Saicho was granted permission to travel to Tang as a returning student (gengakushou), a short-term overseas trainee."
"In 804, he sailed to Tang on a Japanese embassy ship."
"Saicho traveled to Mount Hiei, a sacred site, and studied Tendai Buddhism and the Great Vehicle Bodhisattva precepts under the Abbot Dōsui, a direct descendant of the Tendai master Zhiyi, and Tendai Buddhism from the Zen Master Kōman."
"Moreover, at Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), he studied esoteric Buddhism from Master Shunxiao and Zen Buddhism from Zen Master Shakunen."
"In the Kojiki and Nihongi, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"While generally considered a deity who personifies the moon and rules the night, alternative interpretations exist (discussed below)."
"Also read as ""Tsukiyomi."""
"While the Kojiki (Chronicles of Japan) contains an account of the slaying of Ogetsu-hime, generally considered a male deity, there is no explicit depiction in the text that definitively establishes its gender."
"In many foreign mythologies, the moon god is often a goddess, and furthermore, warlike goddesses appear frequently in other cultures. Therefore, some scholars argue that the story of the killing of the food goddess cannot be definitively attributed to a male god, and thus support the theory that the deity in question may have been a goddess."
"Tsukiyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are discrepancies in his divine nature depending on the source."
"In the Kojiki, Izanagi, having escaped from Yomi, purified himself and gave birth to Amaterasu from his right eye, and Susanoo from his nose, joining them with Tsukiyomi to form the Three Noble Deities."
"On the other hand, the ""Nihon Shoki"" recounts a different birth story, where the deity was born from the left eye, or emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand. The deity's dominion also varies, encompassing heaven, the sea, and other realms."
"Tsukiyomi, born in a dualistic pairing with Amaterasu, who embodies the sun, has a counterpart in various mythologies, as comparative mythology notes."
"For example, in the Chinese myth of Pangu (recorded in the ""Five Operations Calendar Record""), there is an origin story where upon his death, his left eye became the sun and his right eye the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a separate god from Helios, the sun god, and their identification as one and the same occurred only in later times."
"Also, the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament tells of the creation of the sun and moon on the fourth day, when God made ""two great lights"" in the sky, the sun and the moon, to rule over the day and night, separating the light from the darkness."
"The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, as well, can be considered to follow the pattern of the sun and moon origin myth, common throughout the world, where they are born as a pair."
"Despite being considered a major deity alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo in Japanese mythology, Tsukiyomi appears relatively infrequently in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and his overall role is somewhat limited."
The only mention of the origin of grains is a brief passage in the eleventh book of the fifth section of the *Nihon Shoki*.
There is also a theory that this achieves balance by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"This similar structure is also seen in the cases of Amenominakanushi, who is paired with Takamimusubi and Kamimusubi, and Hosuseri, who is paired with Hori (Yamahiko) and Hodeli (Umihiko)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
"Some believe that Susanoo and another deity are the same, based on overlapping domains and stories."
"In the first volume of the Kojiki, he is said to be born from Izanagi's washing his right eye, and is known as one of the ""Three Noble Children"" along with Amaterasu and Susanoo."
"Tsukiyomi is commanded to ""announce the food of the night,"" but he is never seen in action again."
There is also a theory that Izanami resides in the Yomi no Kuni (Land of Darkness).
"The Fifth Section of the Kojiki's Kamiyo section simply states that Izanagi-no-Mikoto created a moon deity that shone with light following the sun, and sent it to the heavens to rule alongside the sun. However, a different version of the story, found in the First Section, tells that Izanagi-no-Mikoto, holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, gave birth to Amaterasu-omikami, and holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand, gave birth to Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto."
"While there are several narratives where Amaterasu Omikami was instructed to rule the heavens alongside other deities, there is also a story where she was commanded to ""rule the eight hundred layers of the tide of the vast ocean."" This latter tale likely stems from the belief that the moon controls the tides, suggesting multiple, parallel accounts of the birth of the three deities."
"In the eleventh volume of the fifth scroll, Amaterasu Omikami and Tsukuyomi no Mikoto were both commanded to rule heaven.  Later, Tsukuyomi no Mikoto was commanded by Amaterasu to meet with Uke Mochi on high, and he descended to Uke Mochi's presence."
"There is a myth that the Food Goddess, as a gesture of hospitality, offered food from her mouth, causing the Moon God, Tsukoyomi, to become disgusted and kill her with his sword."
"The body of the food deity gave birth to cattle, horses, silkworms, and rice, which became the origin of grains."
"Onmyōji was a government position in the ancient Japanese Ritsuryō system, belonging to the Yin-Yang Division of the Ministry of Central Affairs."
"The position responsible for divination, geomancy, and other techniques based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, originally designated as a technical officer. This role later transcended its original legal mandate to encompass all aspects of divination, sorcery, and ritual practices."
"After the medieval period, the term primarily referred to non-official individuals who practiced divination, magic, and ritual ceremonies in various regions. Today, it is defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination within the community."
"It is sometimes pronounced ""onyouji"" without the sounds being connected."
"The Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory, originating in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and nearly perfected during the Zhou dynasty, which posits that all phenomena are composed of combinations of these concepts, along with its closely related disciplines of astronomy, calendar systems, the I Ching, and timekeeping, were introduced to Japan directly from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) or indirectly via the Korean peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) sometime between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Asuka period, no later than 512 AD (the 7th year of Emperor Keitai's reign) when Five Classics scholars arrived from Baekje, or 554 AD (the 15th year of Emperor Kinmei's reign) when the I Ching scholars arrived."
"While their initial influence on politics and culture was minimal, the arrival of Kanroku from Baekje in 602 AD, considered the pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, significantly impacted national governance. He lectured 34 select officials, including Prince Shotoku, on these disciplines, ushering in a new era of influence."
"Japan first adopted the calendar (Gengakareki) as the official calendar, and in 607 (the 15th year of Empress Suiko's reign), the dispatch of envoys to Sui, a leading civilization at the time, began to absorb Buddhism, yin-yang and five-element thought, and calendar systems. Furthermore, the Seventeen-Article Constitution of Prince Shotoku and the establishment of the twelve ranks of court rank were also heavily influenced by yin-yang and five-element thought."
"Thereafter, the Imperial Court continued to send students with the envoys to Sui (and later Tang) and invited numerous monks and scholars from mainland China or the Korean Peninsula's western coast, where the envoys stopped, in order to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various academic disciplines advanced in Japan, it came to be considered important to ""determine auspiciousness or misfortune and derive guidance for all aspects of human affairs by considering the movement and position of the sun, moon, and stars in accordance with the principles of the Five Elements theory, their inter-relationship and mutual overcoming,"" and the Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy became highly regarded as a method for determining auspiciousness or misfortune and gaining ethical guidelines."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, a master of Tenmon Tonkou who was so adept at the art that he even practiced shiki divination during the Jinshin War, established the Onmyoryo and Japan's first observatory in 676 AD (4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign)."
"The use of the term ""Onmyoji"" began in 685 AD (the 13th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), indicating the growing popularity of Yin-Yang and Five Elements philosophy. In 718 AD, the Yoro Code formalized the establishment of the Onmyo-ryo, a bureau within the Ministry of Central Affairs (Ryō), appointing permanent officials such as Astronomers, Onmyo Doctors, Onmyo Masters, Calendar Experts, and Clepsydra Experts. This marked the official recognition of Onmyo-ryo as a divination institution alongside the Kami-gwan's tortoise-shell divination."
"Only those skilled in the techniques transmitted from the mainland were appointed as doctors and onmyoji, these being mostly immigrants proficient in various subjects and adept at reading Classical Chinese, hailing from the former Han, Later Han, Sui which usurped the mainland hegemony, Goguryeo and Baekje who held sway over the western coast of the Korean peninsula, and occasionally scholars who returned from Silla, the initial power in the east of the Korean peninsula."
"Particularly in the aftermath of the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (the second year of Tenchi), when Japan, a close ally of Baekje, sent reinforcements and was defeated, leading to the unification of the Korean peninsula by Silla and the collapse of the Baekje dynasty, a large number of intellectuals fled to Japan as refugees. Many of these refugees were subsequently appointed to government positions."
"The initial techniques of the Yin Yang Office were purely focused on divination, geomancy (akin to modern ""feng shui""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and the operation of water clocks. They solely focused on analyzing celestial observations, managing timekeeping, and predicting the fortune of events using theories based on the five elements of yin yang.  They did not engage in any religious rituals or sorcery like the Shinto priests or Buddhist monks. However, the Office played a significant role in choosing auspicious dates for construction projects within the imperial court, and in divination of land and directional auspiciousness, contributing to important decisions such as the relocation of the capital."
The organization of the Onmyōryō as a Ritsuryō bureaucracy and the duties of the Onmyōji.
"The Onmyoryo has administrative officers, who serve as..."
"The position supervises the Yin Yang Liao, oversees astronomy, calendar, weather, and celestial phenomena, secretly records and seals any anomalies without external disclosure, and submits secret reports (astronomical secret submissions) to the court. The calendar doctor submits the newly compiled calendar for the new year on the 1st of November each year (imperial calendar submission). Additionally, the position submits reports on divinations and geomancy results as needed."
