"Shinzo New Island advocated the cultivation of individuals who ""utilize their conscience in their actions"" as the purpose of education."
"It is desired to produce people who are ""filled with conscience"" by promoting ""moral education"" based on Christianity in parallel with knowledge education, so as not to be biased towards knowledge education."
Monuments engraved with his handwriting of that sentiment exist at various schools such as Doshisha University.
"The words ""May the spirit of righteousness fill the entire body and give rise to a strong will"" are engraved on this monument of conscience."
"Furthermore, as an educational philosophy to concretely realize this ""conscience"" education, ""Christianity,"" ""liberalism,"" and ""internationalism"" are advocated, aiming to produce individuals who embody the ""conscience of a nation"" through these principles."
"It is a school corporation of Protestant Christianity, following the tradition of congregationalist churches (union churches)."
"However, it is different in nature from so-called mission-based universities, and does not have the primary purpose of Christian evangelism (does not use education itself as a means of evangelism)."

"Born in Kyoto, said to be the illegitimate child of Emperor Go-Komatsu."
"In the diary of Sugawara no Nagatada, ""Record of Lord Tokiwa Nagatada,"" on August 1st of the third year of Meio (1494), it is written: ""It is said in a secret tradition that the monk Ikkyu is a royal offspring of the later Emperor Komatsu."""
There is no one in the world who knows it.
"The childhood name was Chigikumaru, according to later historical records."
"He was called Zhou Jian as he grew older, and went by the nicknames Crazy Cloud, Blind Donkey, and Dream Chamber."
"The posthumous Buddhist name is Shu Jun, also written as Shu Jun."
Ikkyu is a Buddhist monk's title.
"Please refer to the ""posthumous Buddhist names"" section for information on posthumous names and Buddhist titles."
"At the age of 6, he entered the Ankokuzan Hōkō-ji in Kyoto and received the precepts, and was named Chikamasa."
"From an early age, he excelled in poetry, and his Chinese poems ""Changmen Spring Grass"" written at the age of 13 and ""Spring Clothes Lodging Flowers"" written at the age of 15 became well-known and praised in the capital city."
"In the 17th year of Oei (1410), at the age of 17, he became a disciple of Ken'o Soin and changed his Buddhist name to Soshun."
"At this time, it cannot be determined whether Ikkyu's behavior is due to his master's passing, but he has attempted suicide."
"In the 22nd year of the Ōei era (1415), he became a disciple of Kasō Sōdon, a prominent monk at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto."
"He received the monastic name Ikkyu from Kaso for his response to the public case of ""The Stick of Dongshan Thrice Struck,"" saying, ""Returning from the nonexistent to the nonexistent, take a rest. If it rains, let it rain. If the wind blows, let it blow."""
"""Furthermore, 'aroriji (world of defilement)' refers to the world of delusion (afflictions), and 'muroji (world of enlightenment)' refers to the world of enlightenment (Buddha)."""
"One night in the 27th year of Oei (1420), upon hearing the cry of a crow, I suddenly had a great realization."
"The old man tried to give Ikkyu a certificate of approval, but Ikkyu declined."
"It is said that the old man sent him off with a laugh, calling him a fool."
"Afterwards, I lived a life of poetry, wild songs, calligraphy, and eccentricity."
"In the first year of Shochou (1428), Emperor Ko'o passed away without leaving a male heir, and Emperor Gohanazono was welcomed from the Fushimi-no-miya family and ascended to the throne."
It is said that Ikkyu recommended the enthronement of Emperor Goharazono.
"From ""The Biography of Ikkyu Sojun in the East Sea."""
"However, Imaizumi Yoshio argues that the enthronement of Go-Hanazono Emperor was approved by the shogunate and was unrelated to Ikkyu's recommendation."
"In the sixth year of Bunmei after the Ōnin War (1474), he was appointed as the head priest of Daitoku-ji by the decree of Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado and worked tirelessly for its revival, though he did not reside in the temple."
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto Imperial Palace) is the imperial residence located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture."
"Due to the Tokyo Imperial Visit during the Meiji Restoration, the Emperor moved to the Imperial Palace in Tokyo (formerly Edo Castle), which was preserved in the 10th year of Meiji (1877)."
"Since the Meiji era, it has also been called the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Originally, the official Imperial Palace in Heian-kyo was located in the central part of Heian-kyo, but it was moved to the Rikyu Palace due to wars and other factors."
"The Togu-do-in Palace of the Tsuchimikado East Inner Palace was one of the palaces within this imperial residence where the imperial family of the Jomyo-in lineage, later known as the Northern Court, resided throughout generations."
"By the way, the Imperial Palace of the Daikakuji lineage, which would later be known as the Southern Court, was located at Nijo Tomikoji Uchiraku."
"The modern Kyoto Imperial Palace is not the same as the original Dōgōniwa Palace, but rather an expanded version based on it."
"Usually, you can visit by applying, and it is open to the public in spring and autumn."
The Kyoto Imperial Palace served as the residence and office of successive emperors until the Imperial Court moved to Tokyo in the second year of the Meiji era (1869).
"The Kyoto Imperial Palace in the present day (21st century) is classified as ""Imperial Property"" under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency and is owned by the state."
"Adjacent to Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sentō Imperial Palace, and across the street to the north on Imadegawa Street are Doshisha University and Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts (both campuses are on Imadegawa Street)."
"Currently, the Imperial Household Agency manages the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kyoto Imperial Villa, and Sentō Imperial Palace, while the Ministry of the Environment manages the Kyoto Gyoen National Garden surrounding them."
"Kyoto residents often simply refer to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, including the Kyoto Gyoen, as the ""Gosho."""
"There is a theory that the relatively low walls surrounding the Imperial Palace, unlike the high walls of castles in other countries, reflect the difference in the sense of closeness between the common people and rulers (such as the Emperor and the imperial family) in the East and the West."
"For example, one of the reasons for such analysis is that in Japan, there has been no occurrence of an event like when commoners invaded the royal palace of Versailles, the residence of the ruler (king) during the French Revolution."
"The original Imperial Palace of Heian-kyo was located considerably to the west of the current Kyoto Imperial Palace, near Nijo Station of West Japan Railway, at the northeast corner of the Senbon Marutamachi intersection."
"The current Kyoto Imperial Palace was originally one of the residences of the retired Emperor, called the Tsuchimikado Higashinotoin Palace, and was first used by Emperor Kogon of the Northern Court in the first year of Genko (1331)."
"The Imperial Palace that was once located here was rebuilt eight times only during the Edo period (six of which were due to fires), and the existing building was rebuilt in the late Edo period in the second year of Ansei (1855) in the Heian style, and is called the Ansei Imperial Palace."
"In the 10th year of the Meiji era (1877), Emperor Meiji, who had moved to the Tokyo Imperial Palace, visited Kyoto and lamented the deteriorating state of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, which had fallen into disrepair within 10 years of his visit to Tokyo. He ordered for the preservation of the palace and the maintenance of its old appearance."
"Main buildings include Shishinden, Seiryoden, Kogosho, Ogakumonjo, Tsunegoten, Koushun, Osuzumisho, and Empress's Palace."
"The enthronement ceremony has been traditionally held at the Shishin-den in the Kyoto Imperial Palace for generations. Even after the Emperor moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration, according to the old Imperial Household Law established in 1889 (Meiji 22), it was stipulated that the enthronement ceremony and the Daijosai ceremony should be held in Kyoto. Both Emperor Taisho and Emperor Showa also performed their enthronement ceremonies at the Kyoto Imperial Palace."
"Furthermore, there are no specific provisions in the current Imperial Household Law established after World War II regarding the location where the enthronement ceremony should be held, such as in Kyoto. In 1990, during the enthronement of the current Emperor, for the first time in history, the enthronement ceremony was held at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo."
"During the enthronement ceremony, the Emperor sits on the Takamikura, the official throne symbolic of the Emperor's reign, which is located in the Shishin-den of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. Therefore, for the current Emperor's enthronement ceremony, known as the ""Sokuirei Seiden no Gi"" (equivalent to the ""Shishin-den no Gi""), the Takamikura was temporarily relocated to the Imperial Palace."
"Sumoku, kirizuma-tsukuri, hiwada-buki, hashira-aida ikken no shikyaku mon de aru."
"The gate is opened only for special events such as the arrival of the Emperor, dignitaries, and foreign guests, as well as for public viewing."
"In the left and right Tsukiji walls, there are five lines (horizontal lines) running through them, which also represent the highest level of formality as a wall."
"Passing through this gate and under the vermilion-lacquered tiled Shouming Gate, you will arrive at the front of the Purple Palace."
"Gagaku is one of the traditional music of Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, and Vietnam."
The following will focus on Japanese gagaku transmitted to the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu Department Music Department (Important Intangible Cultural Property).
"The original meaning of Gagaku is ""elegant and correct music and dance,"" contrasting with ""popular music."""
"According to the definition by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-gakubu Gakubu, it refers to the repertoire performed by the Imperial Household Agency Shikibu-gakubu Gakubu excluding Western music."
Many of them have been passed down as court music in instrumental compositions.
It is the world's oldest style of traditional music still performed in large ensemble form today.
"However, as a traditional form of ensemble music, it had been discontinued for over 100 years since the Ōnin War until the Tokugawa Shogunate gathered the descendants of court musicians (gakusha) and reorganized it, so it is questionable how much of the Heian period form has been inherited."
"When singing a score written in katakana of the shakuhachi, it is speculated that the characteristics of Japanese pronunciation before the 16th century are faithfully reproduced, such as pronouncing the ""ha"" row as ""fa, fi, fu, fe, fo"" when adding rhythm to the musical notation to sing it as a hymn."
"Things written in kanji, like the score of the raku biwa, have many similarities with the biwa scores found in Dunhuang, China, and many styles that were passed down from an even older continent are further inherited."
"One of the most important historical sources is the ""Taigen Shō"" written by Toyohara Tsunematsu (1450-1512), who was concerned about the dispersal of records of gagaku and other arts during the Ōnin War."
"Tsukiai, the head of the Shakuhachi family, compiled records on Gagaku and Bugaku centered around the shakuhachi. It is a valuable record of ancient Gagaku."
"The music for rituals that originated from China, the Korean Peninsula, and South Asia before the 10th century."
"In China, ya-yüe was music performed at ceremonies."
"However, among the pieces currently performed in Japanese gagaku, Tang music, which is said to have been transmitted from China, is said to be based on music that was performed at banquets called Yan music in Tang Dynasty."
"In terms of music categories, names with international colors such as Tang music, Goryeo music, and Lin Yi music (music of Champa) are transmitted, and elements of ancient Japanese music from before the introduction of music from the continent are also included."
"Before modern times, the oldest styles were transmitted by the Sanjo Gakuso of Shitenno-ji Temple (Osaka), the Dainagon Gakuso of the Imperial Palace (Kyoto), and the Nanto Gakuso of Kasuga Shrine (Nara), which were considered the three major Gakuso."
"These music schools were called to Tokyo in modern times, forming the basis of the current music department of the Imperial Household Agency, but the traditions of each music school continue in their respective regions."
"In addition, mutual influences can be seen between folk songs and statements, creating a unique Japanese style."
"Currently, around 100 pieces have been inherited by the Imperial Household Agency Music Department."
Refer to the lyrics of S-style song and dance.
Items brought from outside Japan (some consider only these to be gagaku).
"Left dance, Tang music... Chinese, Indian, and Linyi (Southern Vietnam) origins."
"Right-hand dance, Goryeo music... Korean and Bohai (Northeast China) origin"
These include songs produced in Japan imitating the above-mentioned style (Japanese music) as well.
Songs (utaimono) created during the Heian period
The lyrics refer to the song.
There are cases where ancient songs and dances in the Japanese style are collectively referred to as ancient songs and dances.
Emperor Kanmu (737-806) was the 50th Emperor of Japan.
Emperor Kanmu was born as the first son of Prince Shirakabe (later Emperor Kōnin) in the 9th year of Tenpyō (737).
"According to the Nihon Shoki, Takano Shinkasa, the mother, is a descendant of the Baekje royal family, whose ancestor is King Munju of Baekje."
"Empress Fujiwara no Otomuro gave birth to Prince Yasusada (later Emperor Heijō), and Empress Fujiwara no Tabiko gave birth to Prince Ohotomo (later Emperor Junna)."
"Even after his father, the White Wall King, ascended to the throne, Prince Takano Shinkasa was not desired to be the Crown Prince because his mother was from the low-ranking immigrant clan of the Wa clan. Initially, he aimed for career advancement as a bureaucrat and served as a chamberlain, head of the university, and vice minister of the center."
"However, due to political disputes involving the Fujiwara clan, the former Crown Prince and his mother, Empress Inoue, were suddenly deposed and the younger half-brother was proclaimed Crown Prince on January 2, 773."
"Disliking the growing influence of Nara Buddhism temples in Heijokyo, the capital was moved to Yamashiro Province."
"In 784, Nagaoka-kyo was built, but in 794, Heian-kyo was built again."
"In order to invade the Tohoku region and subjugate the Emishi, a military force was sent with Sakanoue no Tamuramaro appointed as the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force."
"However, in his later years, he was criticized by Fujiwara no Yoshitsugu of the Fujiwara Shikike family for causing suffering to the peasants with such military actions and constructions."
It is said that he proposed the compilation of the Nihon Shoki in terms of culture.
Saicho and Kukai returned from Tang China and brought new movements to Japanese Buddhism under the reign of Emperor Kammu.
"The unnatural deaths of Princess Inoue and Prince Tamura, as well as the dark aspect of exiling and causing the death of Prince Sawara, who was made Crown Prince at the beginning of his reign, on charges of assassinating Fujiwara no Taneie in 785."
"Out of fear of vengeful spirits, on July 19, 800 AD, Emperor Shōmu posthumously honored Prince Sawa as Emperor Sūdō, designated Princess Inoue's tomb as a mausoleum, and restored the position of Empress."
"Known as the protectors of Saicho and Kukai, on the other hand, the existing Buddhism had too much power involved in the government, so they put pressure on various factions known as the so-called ""Nanto Rokushu"" by confiscating their land."
"It is also said that the disorder in the imperial harem led to the later ""Incident at Yaxi,"" serving as a breeding ground for it."
"He died on March 17, 806, in the 25th year of the Enryaku era."
"Emperor Jimmu, who was posthumously known as Yamato Takeru Iharede no Mikoto, was the first emperor of Japan."
"Along with this, Emperor Kanmu was posthumously given the Chinese-style posthumous title."
"Kashiwabara Emperor, also known as Tenkoku Oshi Wataru Miya Kashiwabara Tenno."
"The tomb is considered to be the Kashiwabara Mausoleum (Kashiwabara no Misasagi) in Momoyama-cho, Fushimi-ku, Kyoto City."
"Before his death, he was insistent on being buried in Utono, but due to various reasons, he was buried at Fushimi's Kashiwabara Mausoleum."
"In the Meiji era, the first emperor of Heian-kyo was enshrined at Heian Shrine."
"All emperors are enshrined in one of the three main shrines of the Imperial Palace, the Ko-reiden."
"On December 18, 2001, before the Emperor's birthday, which has become a tradition, Akihito made a statement during a press conference regarding the co-hosting of the FIFA World Cup the following year, saying, ""I feel a connection with the Republic of Korea as it is recorded in the Nihon Shoki that the mother of Emperor Kanmu is a descendant of King Munmu of Baekje."""
"This statement was not widely covered in Japan, but it was heavily reported in the South Korean media and became a topic of discussion."
"Some reports have greatly exaggerated the logic of theories such as ""The Imperial Family has Korean lineage"" and ""The Imperial Family is of Baekje origin."""
"The Otani family (Otanike) is the family name of the descendants of Kakuei, the son of Kakushin-ni and Hino Hirotuna."
"Hino Hirotune was a lower-ranking nobleman in Kyoto, and Kakushin-ni was the daughter of Shinran who inherited the position of head priest of Hongan-ji, the majority sect of Jodo Shinshu."
"When surnames became mandatory during the Meiji era, both the head priests of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji-ha (Nishi Honganji) and the head priests of the Shinshu Otani-ha (Shinshu Honbyo) which split in 1602, took on their titles as surnames."
"The origin of the Otani surname is due to the fact that the mausoleum of Shinran, mentioned later, was established in the Otani area north of the Chion-in Temple's north gate in Higashiyama, Kyoto."
"Hongan-ji was considered one of the daimyo of the Sengoku period in Japan due to its power as a result of the spread of the Ikko Ikki movement. It is common to refer to the head priest with the title ""Hongan-ji Kenyo"" or ""Hongan-ji Kosai"" by incorporating Hongan-ji into their posthumous Buddhist names (Jodo Shinshu), but this is simply for convenience and does not mean that the head priest's family lineage made Hongan-ji their surname. There was no family or clan known as the Hongan-ji clan."
"Kakushinni watched over Shinran as he passed away in 1262, and in 1272 she built a temple in Otani near their home in Higashiyama, Kyoto to enshrine his remains."
"Daianji Temple became a place of worship for Jodo Shinshu followers as a mausoleum for Shinran, and Shinran's eldest son, Kakuei, was appointed as the caretaker of the temple."
"However, the Otani mausoleum later became a source of conflict between the disciple Kakuei and his stepbrother Yuizen, as they vied for control over the temple and the donations from followers of various provinces. Kakuei eventually emerged victorious, establishing the hereditary succession of the temple within his own family."
"In 1312, Kakunyo converted the mausoleum into a temple, giving birth to the Jodo Shinshu sect's headquarters, the Otani Honganji Temple."
"Since then, the descendants of Kakunyo inherited Hongan-ji and advanced the formation of the sect. During the time of the fifth generation Shinkyo in the Muromachi period, they expanded to the Hokuriku region, and by the time of the seventh generation Zonnyo, the Hongan-ji sect had been formed in Kaga, Noto, Echizen, Omi, and other provinces."
"However, compared to other lineages of Jodo Shinshu that have been working on forming a religious organization since the death of Shinran, the formation of the organization in the early Muromachi period was significantly delayed. Honzanji, in the early Muromachi period, was considered a sub-temple of Seiren-in, and it is said that the Otani family, through their connection to the Hino family (Shinran's family), also served as stewards for the Kujō family."
"In the latter half of the 15th century, the activities of Rennyo, who became the 8th head priest, led to the spread of the Honganji sect throughout Japan. However, in 1465, the main Honganji temple was destroyed and the head priest moved to Yoshizaki in Echizen, and then to the Yamashina district on the outskirts of Kyoto."
"In Kaga, against the backdrop of the expansion of the teachings during the time of Rennyo, the Kaga Ikko Ikki occurred in 1488, leading to the expulsion of the guardian Tomogashi family by the Honganji sect in Kaga, creating a situation known as the ""country ruled by peasants."""
"For approximately one hundred years until 1580, it became a country ruled by the Ikko sect."
"In the 16th century, amidst the chaos of the Warring States period, the Honganji sect, starting from small farmers, strengthened its organizational power and became active in various parts of Japan, reaching the samurai class such as local retainers and landowners. However, the Yamashina Honganji temple suffered from the Tenbun Hokke Disturbance in 1532, and the 10th head, Shonyo, moved to the Ishiyama Gobo founded by Rennyo in Nishinaru-gun, Settsu Province (present-day Osaka City), renaming it Ishiyama Honganji temple."
Ishiyama Hongan-ji was located at the top of a hill at the northern end of the Kamimachi Plateau.
It controlled the important river traffic hub of Osaka at the mouth of the Yodogawa River.
"Based in Ishiyama Hongan-ji, Shonin sought to strengthen ties with various daimyo, the shogunate, and the imperial court, stabilizing the power base of Hongan-ji."
"On the other hand, from the end of the Shojo era, in regions such as Hokuriku, some followers of the Honganji sect were beginning to deviate from the control of Honganji and pursue their own path."
"During the time of the 11th head priest Kenyo, the Honganji sect, which had effectively become an independent daimyo power, expanded into the Kinai region and came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga, who sought to establish unified control by taking away feudal lord power from religious forces."
"The conflict between the Hongan-ji temple and the Oda clan, which lasted for ten years from 1570, known as the Ishiyama War, saw the fortified Hongan-ji temple in Ishiyama being held by Kennyo and others, while Hongan-ji followers across the country coordinated resistance movements against the Oda clan. This collaboration allowed the Hongan-ji temple to gain the upper hand and greatly trouble Nobunaga."
"However, in 1574, Ganjo-ji in Nagashima-cho, Ise Province (Mie Prefecture) was destroyed by the Oda clan, and in 1575, the Ikko Ikki that recaptured Echizen from the Oda clan was annihilated, weakening resistance in various regions. In 1578, the Mori clan's navy, allied with the Hongan-ji, was defeated by the Oda navy in the Battle of Kizu River, further adding to the defeats outside of the Hongan-ji."
"While maintaining its strength by gathering support from the Iga clan and others, Ishiyama Hongan-ji gradually became isolated among its enemies. In 1580, it finally succumbed to Nobunaga, who obtained an imperial decree from Emperor Ogimachi, and retreated from Ishiyama Hongan-ji. The power of Hongan-ji as a feudal lord disappeared."
"At this time, Chōshi Kyōnyo and Kensho disagreed over continuing to resist against Kensho's intentions. When Kensho passed away in 1593, his third son Junnyo was appointed as his successor."
"From this point on, Honganji Temple began to walk the path of division over the position of the gatekeeper, and in 1602 Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Kyoju a separate temple ground from Junjo and established the East Honganji Temple."
"At this time, many followers from the Jodo Shinshu sect led by Junyo, who became the head of Nishi Honganji, began to move to the sect led by Kyonyo, the head of Higashi Honganji, causing Honganji to split into east and west."
"Shinran, originally the son of Hino Arinori, a court noble, and the head of the Eastern and Western Tani families, who descended from Hino Hirosada (the father of Kakunyo), followed the custom of becoming adopted sons of powerful court nobles for generations. They also continued to intermarry with court nobles, furthering their noble lineage through the maternal line."
Kyotanabe City is located near the border of Osaka Prefecture and Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture.
"Kyo-tanabe City is located in the central part of the tri-prefectural triangle area, bordering Yawata City, Joyo City, Ikoma Town in Tsuzuki County, Seika Town in Sōraku County, Hirakata City in Osaka Prefecture, and Ikoma City in Nara Prefecture in the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture."
"Kizugawa River flows north to south on the east side of the city (Kyoto Prefecture), while the city is sandwiched between the Ikoma Mountains on the west side, with the JR West Kameoka Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line passing through the central area."
"Kyoto, Nara, and Osaka have a strong character as bedroom communities."
"On April 1, 1997, the town of Tanabe in Tsukigata District was incorporated as a city."
"In Kyoto Prefecture, it was born as the 12th city in 20 years since the city of Yawata, and the 669th city in the country."
"In order to avoid duplication with Tanabe City in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture's Tanabe Town in Tsuzuki District was renamed to ""Kyoto Prefecture Tanabe City"" with the prefix ""Kyoto"" to become ""Kyotanabe City"", and the city's name change was implemented on the same day."
The new city name was selected through a public solicitation process.

"As the representative stations of the city, there are Kintetsu Nintoku Station, JR Kyotanabe Station, and Matsuiyamate Station."
"Kintetsu Shindenba Station and JR Kyotanabe Station serve as the center of Kyotanabe City, while Matsuiyamate Station functions as the central station of Keihan Higashi Rose Town."
"In addition, regular subway trains on the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line also stop at Kintetsu Nintenji Station."
JR Kyōtanabe Station was originally named Tanabe Station and was renamed to match the city name around the same time as the city's incorporation.
This is a similar case to Nishikyogoku Station and Higashimukōjima Station on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.
"In Tanabe City, Wakayama Prefecture, there is a station called ""Kii-Tanabe Station"" (Kisei Main Line). It is believed that the name ""Kii"" from the old province name of Wakayama Prefecture is included in the name of the station in Tanabe City to avoid duplication of station names within the West Japan Railway Company's jurisdiction."

"Musashi Province (Musashi no kuni) was once one of the provinces in the Ritsuryo system, a local administrative division in Japan."
"This corresponds to the area east of the Sumida River in the current Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, excluding the islands, as well as the northeastern part of Kanagawa Prefecture (including all of Kawasaki City and the eastern and coastal areas of Yokohama City)."
"The rank in the Engishiki is the provincial governor, provincial class division, and distant provinces."
Heian-kyo was established as the capital of Japan by Emperor Kammu in 794 (Enryaku 13).
"Heian-kyo was constructed in an area spanning Katsura District and Atago District in Yamashiro Province, which corresponds to the present-day central part of Kyoto City in Kyoto Prefecture. It was a capital city divided into a rectangular grid measuring 4.5 km east-west and 5.2 km north-south."
"In the center of the northern end of the capital, the Imperial Palace is established, and from there, Suzaku Avenue runs through the center of the city, with the districts of Rakuchu (on the left side) and Rakugai (on the right side) on either side."
"The layout plan is basically modeled after Heijokyo, following the example of Sui and Tang's Chang'an."
"However, there were no city walls."
There is also a theory that the selection of this land was based on the Four Gods corresponding to Feng Shui transmitted from China.
The area of Heian-kyo is smaller than the current Kyoto city.
"The northern limit of the main street is Ichijo Street, which is located between Imadegawa Street and Marutamachi Street."
"The southern boundary of Kujo Oji is Kujo Street, slightly south of the current JR Kyoto Station."
The eastern limit of Tokyo's Gokumai Road corresponds to the present Teramachi Street.
The estimated location of Nishijin Nishikyo Oji in the west is a line connecting the JR West Sanin Main Line Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line Nishikyogoku Station north and south.
"Within the capital, the city was divided into ""towns"" measuring approximately 40 meters in each direction by main roads and side streets running east, west, north, and south."
"A collection of four rows of towns lined up in the east-west direction (excluding the two rows on the northern edge) is called a ""jo,"" and a collection of four rows lined up in the north-south direction is called a ""bo."""
"In the 16 towns belonging to the same district, each one was assigned a number."
"As a result, each town was called ""Ukyo Gojo Sanbo Juu Yoncho""."
"The width of the road was at least 4 jo (about 12m) in small roads, and 8 jo (about 24m) in main roads."
The existing roads in Kyoto City are much narrower in most places than this.
"At the entrance to Suzaku Avenue, there was a width of 28 zhang (about 84 meters)."
"In addition, there were rivers (Horikawa, Nishi Horikawa) flowing parallel to Horikawa-koji and Nishi Horikawa-koji."
Emperor Kanmu moved the capital to Yamashiro Province in 784 and built Nagaoka-kyo.
"It is said that there was an intention to move away from the powerful nobles and temples that had supported the reign of Emperor Tenmu, which originated in Yamato Province, and establish a new capital for Emperor Tenchi."
"However, just 10 years later in 794, Emperor Kammu relocated the capital to the northern part of Yamashiro Province, and Heian-kyo was established."
"This relocation of the capital is believed to have been influenced by a series of incidents leading from the assassination of Fujiwara Tanezane in Nagaoka-kyo to the removal of Prince Sawara, as well as the slow progress of construction in Nagaoka-kyo."
"The construction of Heian-kyo is believed to have started with the building of the Imperial Palace (Dairi), followed by the construction of the city (urban area)."
"However, due to the fact that the area of Ukyo is a wetland formed by the Katsura River (Yodo River system), urbanization did not progress even into the 9th century."
"In the 10th century, when the Ritsuryo system had largely become obsolete, there were cases where land was abandoned and converted for agricultural use, even though it was prohibited within the capital."
"The residential areas of the nobility were established in the left capital, excluding the northern part of the right capital close to the Daijō-kan."
"The Nihon Koki is an imperial chronicle compiled in the early Heian period, and it is the third of the six national histories following the Nihon Shoki."
"Completed in the 7th year of the Jōwa era (840), it covers a period of 42 years from the 11th year of the Enryaku era (792) to the 10th year of the Tenchō era (833)."
The editor is Fujiwara no Morotoshi and others.
"According to the preface, in the 10th year of Konin (819), Emperor Saga ordered Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, Fujiwara no Osotsugu, Fujiwara no Sadatsugu, and Yoshimine Yasuyo to compile the text."
"Three people died excluding the unfinished succession, so Emperor Junna later ordered Kiyohara Natsuno, Prince Naoyuki, Fujiwara Yoshino, Ono Mimasu, Sakagami Imotsugu, and Shimada Kiyota to continue."
"During the reign of Emperor Nimmyo, further edicts were issued to Fujiwara no Morotsugu, Minamoto Tsunemoto, Fujiwara Yoshino, Fujiwara Yoshifusa, and Asano Shikari."
"Furthermore, after adding Furutakaniwa and Yamada Furuetsugu, the completion was finally reported on December 9, 841 (January 5, 841)."
"It took 21 years to compile, and the only person who was involved in the project spanning three emperors was Fujiwara no Morotomo."
"Following the ""Nihon Shoki,"" this text records the reigns of Emperor Heijou, Emperor Saga, and Emperor Junna during the reign of Emperor Kanmu."
"In the early 15th century, there were 40 volumes of the text, but they were later lost. It was not until the disciple of Hanawa Hōkiichi, Inayama Yukinori, discovered a manuscript of 10 volumes at the Sanjō Nishi family (there is also a theory that it was edited by Yanagihara Norimitsu) that it was first published."
"The existing volumes are volumes 5, 8, 12, 13 (Kammu), 14, 17 (Heijokyo), 20, 21, 22, 24 (Saga), totaling 10 volumes, with a complete absence of Emperor Junna's reign."
"It is possible to partially reconstruct the text from the excerpts of the six national histories such as ""Nihonki Ryaku"" and the classification of topics in the ""Ruiju Kokushi""."
"There are ""Nihon Isshi"" and ""Nihon Kokki Isson"" which collect excerpts from various places, based on these, the following Shueisha translations and Kodansha academic paperbacks on Japanese history have been published."
It is said that the opinions of Fujiwara no Michitsugu are most reflected in the content.
"Adding short biographies (obituaries) to the death articles of the Emperor and court officials is in line with the ""Continuation of Japanese Chronicles"" and is the same as other subsequent historical books."
"However, the obituary in this book does not flow into one-sided, official praise or criticism, but rather contains many interesting descriptions with unique critiques and impressions, making it unique in the Rikkokushi for maintaining a critical spirit."
It is known that the Rikkokushi contains more waka poems compared to earlier and later historical records.
Sei Shonagon (circa 966 - circa 1025) was a female writer and poet during the Heian period.
"There is a theory that her real name is Nagiko Kiyohara, but it is uncertain."
"The daughter of the famous poet Kiyohara no Motosuke (908-990), one of the ""Five Poets of the Pear Courtyard,"" in his later years."
"There is an old tradition that identifies the mother as ""Higaki no Ouna"" in the ""Gosen Wakashu,"" but this is nothing more than a wild and baseless theory."
"My great-great-grandfather (some say great-grandfather) is the representative poet of the Kokin Wakashu, Kiyohara no Motosuke."
"Among his siblings, there is a woman who became the wife of Gagaku leader Narinari, Dazai Shōkan, Hana-san'in no Hōshi Kaihide, and Fujiwara Norinaga (the siblings of Fujiwara no Michizane's mother)."
"""Sei Shonagon"" is a pseudonym, with ""Sei"" taken from her family name of Seiwa and ""Shonagon"" taken from a court title in her family."
"The real name is unknown, and there is a theory that it is ""Nagiko"" (excerpt from ""Makura no Soshi""), but it is not reliable to believe."
"She is counted as one of the Thirty-Six Immortal Poets of the Heian period, and her collection of 42 poems, ""Kiyoshinagono Shu,"" is known to have been passed down (though some versions contain only 31 poems)."
"In the ""Goshūi Wakashū,"" 14 poems are included in the imperial anthology."
Ashikaga Yoshiteru was the 15th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate and the last shogun of the Muromachi shogunate (reign: Eiroku 11 (1568) - Tensho 16 (1588)).
"The father was the 12th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"His mother is Keijuin, the daughter of Konoe Hisamichi."
"The 13th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiteru, is the half-brother."
"At first, he was a monk, but when Yoshiteru was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, he escaped from Kyoto with the help of Hosokawa Yusai and other vassals."
"He was supported by Oda Nobunaga of Mino Province and went up to Kyoto, where he became the 15th shogun."
"Eventually, he came into conflict with Nobunaga, and together with Takeda Shingen and Asakura Yoshikage, they built a coalition to surround Nobunaga."
"At one point, Nobunaga was cornered, but eventually he was expelled from Kyoto by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi shogunate effectively collapsed."
"After that, he spent his remaining years with the support of Motonari Mōri and then Toyotomi Hideyoshi."
"He was born on November 13, 1537, in the sixth year of the Tenbun era, as the second son of the 12th shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiharu."
"Because there was Ashikaga Yoshihide, who was the adopted child of his older brother, he became the adopted child of his maternal grandfather, Konoe Hisamichi, at a young age and entered the Buddhist priesthood (Kofukuji Icchoin), taking the name Kakukei."
He later advanced to the position of Gonsoshosu at Kofukuji Temple.
"In the Eiroku Incident of Eiroku 8 (1565), the 13th Shogun, Yoshiteru, was assassinated by Matsunaga Hisahide and the Sanjo Sanekiyo, and his younger brother, Ashikaga Shuson, who was the head of the Kano-in, was also lured and killed."
"At this time, Yoshiaki was also captured by Matsunaga Hisahide and others, and imprisoned in Kofukuji Temple. (It is said that Hisahide and others feared antagonizing Kofukuji Temple by killing Yoshiaki, who was the younger brother of the shogun and had been promised the position of head priest in the future, so they kept him imprisoned.)"
"However, with the help of vassals Hosokawa Yusai and Wada Koremasa, he managed to escape and on February 17, 1566, in the 9th year of the Eiroku era, he returned to secular life and took the name Yoshiaki."
"In books that describe Yoshiaki, it is noted that he was also referred to by other names such as the Warrior's Residence."
"When he was expelled from Kyoto, he was attacked by night thieves and was also called the ""poor governor."""
"On April 21st, he was quietly promoted to Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade, and appointed as Left Head of the Imperial Guards."
"There are opinions questioning the timing of the appointment, but according to Yamashina Genkitsu's ""Genkitsu Kyo-ki,"" it is written that before the appointment ceremony took place, a messenger from Ashikaga Yoshiaki appeared at Genkitsu's residence on the day of Yoshiaki's appointment as shogun to request his mediation for Yoshiaki's promotion to Jushi-shita. This incident shows that Genkitsu had already received his appointment before this event."
"Yoshiaki, who escaped from Kyoto, initially relied on the father and son, Rokkaku Yoshikata and Rokkaku Yoshiharu of Omi Province, but Yoshiharu secretly colluded with the Miyoshi Three to escape to the nephew of his sister, Takeda Yoshitsugu in Wakasa Province in August."
"However, the Wakasa Takeda clan did not have enough power to go up to the capital due to struggles over succession and power struggles among senior vassals. In September, they fled to the Asakura Yoshiakira in Echizen Province and requested assistance in restoring the shogunate."
"However, Yoshikage Asakura already held the ""Kuruma Valley Palace"" branch of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and did not have the intention of actively going up to the capital with Ashikaga Tsugutomo, who had just returned to secular life, so the trip to the capital did not materialize."
"The role of the crown prince is being performed by Yoshikage Asakura (note that there is no official document or historical source confirming that Yoshiaki had undergone the formal ceremony of coming of age up to this point, and it can be said that his coming of age was too late for the time)."
"Eventually, with the mediation of Akechi Mitsuhide, a senior vassal of the Asakura family, he moved to Mino Province and relied on Oda Nobunaga."
"In September of the 11th year of Eiroku (1568), he was supported by Oda Nobunaga and went up to Kyoto."
"On October 18th, he received the appointment as the 15th shogun from the Imperial Court."
"At the same time, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank and appointed as a Councilor and Left Guard General."
The JR Kyoto Line (JR Kyoto-sen) is the nickname for the section between Kyoto Station and Osaka Station on the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) Tokaido Main Line.
"This nickname has been in use since March 13, 1988."
"The nickname ""JR"" is used to avoid confusion because the Keihan Kyoto Line runs almost parallel to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line (Kyoto Line) of Hankyu Railway and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line of Kintetsu Railway, both connecting at Osaka (Umeda) Station and Kyoto Station."
"The line color is blue (■), and as it is considered the main line of the company along with the JR Kobe Line, the corporate color itself is assigned as the line color."
"Running parallel to the Tokaido Shinkansen and Hankyu Kyoto Main Line along the right bank of the Yodo River, the New Rapid Service connects Kyoto to Osaka in just 28 minutes over a distance of 42.8km (with a maximum speed of 130km/h)."
It is a double-track line in both directions throughout the entire section (outer track and inner track).
"At all stations on the JR Kyoto Line, you can use J-Thru ICOCA, as well as Suica from East Japan Railway Company (JR East), TOICA from Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa from Surutto KANSAI."
The Hankai Line operation management system has been introduced on the entire line.
It is operated in conjunction with the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line.
"In addition to the new rapid, rapid, and local trains that connect to the JR Kobe Line and Biwako Line, special express trains also run to the Hokuriku region, Kansai International Airport, and the Sanin region."
"In addition, nearly half of the local trains run to Shin-Sanda Station on the Fukuchiyama Line."
"After the JR transformation, sleeper express trains to Kyushu departing and arriving at Shin-Osaka, express trains to the Nanki region starting from Tennoji, and the ""Hakuto"" train to the San'in region which started operating with the opening of the Chizu Express, began running directly to Kyoto. As a result, the number of express trains on this section increased dramatically."
"Haruka, which started operating at the same time as the opening of Kansai Airport, had all trains running to Kyoto as regular trains a year later, and the route between Shin-Osaka and Kyoto has become an expressway with about four trains running, including the Thunderbird express train heading towards the Hokuriku region."
"In addition, the sleeper limited express trains from Kyoto to Kyushu were completely abolished in the timetable revision on March 15, 2008."
"In addition, the downbound limited express trains ""Haruka"" and ""Kuroshio"" from Shin-Osaka that pass through the Osaka Loop Line and enter the Hanwa Line, enter the freight line from Ibaraki Station (3rd departure) and enter Shin-Osaka via Suita Signal Station."
"Therefore, it may take slightly longer for limited express and rapid express trains running on the outer tracks to travel the same section, and depending on the time of day, two limited express trains may enter Shin-Osaka station at the same time."
"The track alignment is extremely good along almost the entire Kyoto to Osaka line, allowing speeds of up to 130km/h on the outer tracks except for some curved sections."
"The inner track is also capable of handling speeds up to 120km/h, but express trains never run on the inner track (except for transfer or special trains)."
The limited express trains that run on this section are as follows.
"In addition, in relation to the storage and retrieval of vehicles at Mukohatacho (Kyoto Comprehensive Operation Center), transfer trains such as ""Hamakaze (train),"" ""Tanba (train),"" and ""Hokukinki (train)"" run on this section."
"Furthermore, the transfer train between Mukohata-cho, Osaka, and Thunderbird, Raicho, Kitaguni, travels via the Hokufu Freight Line."
"When storing a train bound for Osaka at the Kyoto Integrated Operations Center, proceed in the direction of Osaka Station, pass through Tsukamoto Station, enter the north freight line from the west side, and merge onto the JR Kyoto Line (outer line) (the reverse route is taken when departing)."
"Therefore, if you are running in and out of the warehouse, the front and back of the formation are reversed."
The Shin-Kaisoku operates direct services from JR Kobe Line Himeji/Sanyo Main Line Aioi/Kamigori/Ako Line from Bizen-Ako to JR Kyoto Line via Biwako Line Nagahama/Hokuriku Main Line Omi-Shiotsu Station to Tsuruga.
"From daytime to evening, trains run every 15 minutes. During the day, one train goes to the Kosei Line, while the remaining three trains continue on the Biwako Line."
All four trains run through to the Biwako Line at night.
Operated with 8 or 12 car formations using JR West 223 series electric trains 1000 series and JR West 223 series electric trains 2000 series.
"The Kyoto Vertical Highway is a high-standard trunk road with a length of approximately 100km, starting in Kumiyama-cho, Kuse-gun, Kyoto Prefecture and ending in Miyazu City in the same prefecture (National Route 478)."
"The long north-south axis of Kyoto Prefecture enhances the collaboration between the northern and southern regions, aiming to revitalize the area. It also serves as a southern outer ring road for the vulnerable high-standard road network in the Kyoto metropolitan area."
"The Governor of Kyoto Prefecture describes this main road as the ""backbone of Kyoto."""
"Currently, three locations, the starting point side, the central part, and the ending point side, are open, with the starting point side operating under the name of the Keishin Bypass instead of the Kyoto Jukan Expressway."
"In general, the Kyoto Tamba Road is often referred to as the Kyoto Vertical Highway."
"The main line section on the Miyazu Amanohashidate IC side does not end here, but is planned to be extended to the Tottori IC of the Tottori Toyooka Miyazu Expressway as a regional high-standard road."
"In addition, the section between Kumiyama-Yodo IC and Oyamazaki JCT/IC is a high-speed national expressway, so the minimum speed limit applies and passage of small vehicles such as motorcycles is not possible."
"For this reason, ETC installation work is currently being carried out at Miyazu Amanohashidate IC and Maizuru Oe IC."
Special vehicles exceeding a width of 2.5 meters are unable to pass.
"Toll road section (Ayabe Miyazu Road is managed by Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, others are managed by West Nippon Expressway Company)"
"There is no exit between Ayabe Kitamoto Tollgate (Ayabe JCT) and Ayabe Ankokuji IC, and it is not possible to only drive on the toll-free section."
"The Kyoto Tanba Wachi IC to Ayabe Ankokuji, which is scheduled to open in the summer to fall of 2008, is planned to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation. At that time, the Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be managed by the Kyoto Prefectural Road Corporation, so the current free section from Ayabe Ankokuji IC to Ayabe JCT is also scheduled to be toll."
"In addition, the current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) will be removed, and the Ayabe Ankokuji toll booth will be newly established."
"Currently, Ayabe Ankokuji Interchange does not have a toll booth, which means there are no toll booths on the main line of the Ayabe-Miyazu Road."
The current Ayabe Kitamoto Line toll booth (Ayabe JCT) is built to be close to a temporary prefab structure.
"The Tanba IC to Kyotanba Wachi IC section is currently under construction by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism and is scheduled to open in fiscal year 2014, but the management system after opening is still unclear."
"February 17, 1988: The general National Route 9 Oinokoshi Kameoka Road (Kutsukake IC to Kameoka IC) opened as a general toll road, and the general National Route 9 Kameoka Road (Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC) opened as a provisional free road."
"On May 6, 1993: Tatukake IC to Chiyogawa IC was changed from National Route 9 to General National Route 478."
"September 9, 1993: Kameoka IC to Chiyogawa IC opens as a toll road for public use."
"March 8, 1998: Ayabe JCT to Maizuru Oe IC opened, connecting to the Maizuru Expressway (now: Maizuru Wakasa Expressway) (provisional 2 lanes for opposing traffic)."
"On October 1, 2005: Due to the privatization of four road-related public corporations, ownership was transferred to the Independent Administrative Agency Japan Expressway Holding and Debt Repayment Organization, and management was transferred to West Nippon Expressway Company."
The sections with a black background color in the IC number field indicate that the road is in service.
"Furthermore, sections with a background color of ■ in the facility name column indicate that the facility is not in use or not yet completed."
The name of the section that is not yet open is a temporary name.
MUJI has no BS.
The number is for another line.
<number> is the scheduled number.
"Enryaku-ji is a temple located in Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, with the entire Mount Hiei at an elevation of 848 meters as its precincts."
Mount Hiei is often referred to as Enryakuji.
It was also known as Hokurei because it was located north of Heian-kyo (Kyoto).
"It is the head temple of the Japanese Tendai sect, opened by the monk Saicho in the early Heian period (767-822)."
The abbot (kanju) is called the Tendai Zasu and oversees the sub-temples.
"Since the establishment of Saicho, it has been one of the centers of Heian Buddhism alongside Mount Koya's Kongobuji Temple."
"In addition to the teachings of the Tendai Lotus Sutra, esoteric Buddhism, Zen (meditation), and nenbutsu were also practiced, giving the appearance of a comprehensive Buddhist university. During the Heian period, it gained great power and received the respect of the imperial family and nobility."
"In particular, the ritual prayers performed by esoteric Buddhism gathered support from the aristocracy of the Heian period, and the esoteric Buddhism of Enryaku-ji Temple, known as ""Daimitsu,"" competed for supremacy against the esoteric Buddhism of To-ji Temple in the Shingon sect."
"""Enryaku-ji"" is a collective term for the Toudou, Saitou, Yokokawa, and other buildings scattered in the precincts from the eastern foothills to the top of Mt. Hiei, known as the three towers and sixteen valleys."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho built a small hermitage called Ichijo Shikan-in, which marked the beginning."
"The temple name ""Enryaku-ji,"" taken from the year of its founding, was granted in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD) after the death of Saichō."
"Enryaku-ji Temple has produced numerous famous monks, including Ennin, Enchin, the founder of the Yuzen Nembutsu school Ryojin, the founder of the Jodo sect Honen, the founder of the Jodo Shinshu sect Shinran, the founder of the Rinzai sect Eisai, the founder of the Soto sect Dogen, and the founder of the Nichiren sect Nichiren. Many of the founders of new Buddhism and famous monks in Japanese Buddhist history have trained on Mount Hiei in their youth, leading to it being called the ""mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism."""
Mount Hiei appears in many literary works.
"In addition, rigorous ascetic practices such as the ""12-year pilgrimage to Mt. Koya"" and the ""1000-day pilgrimage to Mt. Ho"" have been continued to the present day, and as a representative sacred site of Japanese Buddhism, it is also registered as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site."
"Mount Hiei is a mountain whose name is mentioned in the ""Kojiki"", and it is believed to have been a mountain of mountain worship since ancient times. At the Hiyoshi Taisha Shrine in Sakamoto at the eastern foot of the mountain, the deity Oyamazumi no Kami, the landlord deity of Mount Hiei, is enshrined."
"Saicho's secular name was Mitsunobito Hirono, and he was born in the second year of Tenpyo Jingo (766 AD) in Shiga District, Omi Province (Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture). (There is also a theory that he was born in 767 AD)."
"At the age of 15 in the 11th year of the Hōki era (780), he received ordination (became a monk) under the guidance of the monk Gyōhyō at the Ōmi Kokubunji temple, and took the name Saichō."
"At the age of 20, in the 4th year of the Enryaku era (785), I received ordination at Todai-ji Temple in Nara and became a formal monk."
"Young Masumi, with his own thoughts, chose not to seek a stable position in the great temples of Nara, but instead secluded himself in Mount Hiei near his hometown, dedicating himself to training and studying scriptures day and night."
"Saicho considered the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to be the highest among the many scriptures, and he studied the writings of the Chinese Tendai master Zhiyi, known as the ""Three Great Works on the Lotus Sutra"" (""The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra,"" ""The Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,"" and ""The Great Calming and Contemplation"")."
"In the 7th year of Enryaku (788), Saicho established a small temple consisting of Yakushi Hall, Monju Hall, and a scripture repository at the current location of the main hall, naming it Ichijoshikan-in."
"This temple is also called Mt. Hiei Temple, and the temple name ""Enryaku-ji"" with an era name was permitted after the death of Saicho in the 14th year of the Kōnin era (824 AD)."
"During the time of Emperor Kanmu, Saicho relied on him, receiving assistance from the Emperor and his close associates, the Wake clan, and gradually, Mount Hiei Temple prospered as a dojo for national protection guarding the northeast of Kyoto."
"In the 21st year of Enryaku (802 AD), Saicho was permitted to travel to Tang as a returning student (short-term overseas training student)."
"In the 23rd year of Enryaku (804 AD), I crossed over to Tang on a ship as part of a diplomatic mission."
"Enchin studied Tendai teachings and Mahayana Bodhisattva precepts under the guidance of the Tendai master Dojui and the Tendai teacher Chigi, who was a direct disciple of the Tendai founder Saicho, at the sacred site of Mount Hiei."
"In addition, at the Longxing Temple in Yuezhou (Shaoxing), they are studying esoteric Buddhism from Shunxiao Ajari and Zen from Shakunen Zenji."
"In the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, it is said to have been created by Izanagi."
"It is believed to be a god that governs the night by deifying the moon in a normal way, but there are also different theories (described later)."
The reading of the name is also Tsukiyomi.
"There is a story in the Nihon Shoki about the killing of Yasakatsumi, so although generally considered a male deity, there is no description in the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki that determines gender."
"In the myths of other countries, the moon god is often depicted as a goddess, and there are also many goddesses with aggressive personalities in other countries' myths. Therefore, some scholars argue for the goddess theory, as there are elements that do not definitively point to a male god in the story of the killing of Hosokami."
"Tsukuyomi is considered the god of the moon, but there are various differences in his divinity depending on the literature."
"In the Kojiki, it is said that Izanagi was born from his right eye when he escaped from Yomi and performed a purification ritual, and he formed the three noble children along with Amaterasu, who was born from his other eye, and Susanoo, who was born from his nose."
"On the other hand, in the ""Nihon Shoki"", there are stories that Amaterasu was born from the left eye, contrary to the ""Kojiki"", and that she emerged from a white bronze mirror held in the right hand, with her dominion not limited to the heavens or the sea."
"Tsukuyomi is born as a pair with Amaterasu, who symbolizes the sun, but in the field of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that similar ideas exist in various myths."
"For example, in the Chinese legend of Pangu (as recorded in the ""Annals of the Five Emperors""), it is said that after Pangu died, his left eye became the sun and his right eye became the moon. Similarly, in Greek mythology, the sun god Apollo and the moon goddess Artemis are considered twins."
"However, Apollo was originally a different god from the sun god Helios, and it was not until later that the two were identified as the same."
"In addition, in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, on the fourth day of creation, God created ""two great lights"" in the sky, namely the sun and the moon, to govern the day and night respectively, and to separate light from darkness. This is the creation of the sun and moon, as described in the Bible."
The birth of Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi is also considered to follow the pattern of a common worldwide myth of the origin of the sun and moon as a pair.
"In Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is considered an important god alongside Amaterasu and Susanoo, but he does not appear much in the myths of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, and is generally lacking in significant actions."
"It is only briefly mentioned in the ""Nihon Shoki"" Volume 5, Chapter 11-1, about the origin of grains."
There is also a theory that balance is maintained by placing a god who does nothing between the contrasting personalities of Amaterasu and Susanoo.
"A similar structure can also be seen in the relationship between Ameno Nakisawame-no-Mikoto and Takamimusubi, and between Hosuseri and Hoosuseri in relation to Hoori (Yamato Takeru) and Hoderi (Ukemochi)."
This is called the hollow structure of Japanese mythology.
Some people claim that Susano'o is the same god because their domains and episodes overlap.
"In the first volume of the ""Kojiki,"" when Izanagi washed his right eye, Amaterasu and Susanoo were born, together known as the ""Three Noble Children."""
"Tsukuyomi was ordered to ""inform the land of night eating,"" but after that, he never appeared again."
There is also a theory that there is a country called Yomi where the god Izanami resides.
"In the fifth section of the Age of the Gods in the Kojiki, it is briefly stated that ""the god of the moon, shining with a brilliance second only to the sun, was born and sent to the heavens to rule alongside the sun."" However, in the following first volume, there is a different account that Izanagi-no-Mikoto gave birth to Oho-namuchi-no-Mikoto by holding a white bronze mirror in his left hand, and gave birth to Tsukiyomi-no-Mikoto by holding a white bronze mirror in his right hand."
"There are several stories about being instructed to rule the heavens along with Amaterasu, and there is also a story about being commanded to control the eight hundred layers of the tide of the Cang Hai Yuan (this seems to have come from the idea that the moon controls the tides), with multiple stories of the birth of the three gods being parallel."
"In the fifth section of the Kojiki, it is said that Amaterasu-Omikami and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto were both ordered to rule the heavens together. However, later Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto received an order to descend from the heavens to meet with the god of food, Ukemochi, sent by Amaterasu."
"In response, the god Hojokami spat out food as an offering, but Tsukiyomi no Mikoto was disgusted and angry, so he killed Hojokami with a sword."
"From the corpse of the food god were born cows, horses, silkworms, rice plants, etc., and this became the origin of grains."
"Onmyoji (onmyoji, onyoji) is one of the official positions that belonged to the Onmyoryo of the Nakatsukasa Department in ancient Japan under the Ritsuryo system."
"It refers to the position of a practitioner (technician) who performs divination and geomancy based on the Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and later goes beyond the original Ritsuryo regulations to oversee divination, sorcery, and all kinds of rituals."
"Since the Middle Ages, the term has come to refer mainly to non-official individuals who practice divination, sorcery, and rituals privately in various places, and in modern times it has been defined as a type of priest who performs private prayers and divination in the private sector."
"It may also be pronounced as ""on'yōji"" without linking sounds."
"It is believed that all phenomena are based on the combination of Yin-Yang and Five Elements ideology, which began in ancient China during the Xia and Shang dynasties and was almost completed during the Zhou dynasty. Astronomy, calendars, divination, and timekeeping, which are closely related to this ideology, were introduced to Japan from the Chinese mainland (Han and Sui dynasties) directly or through the western regions of the Korean Peninsula (Goguryeo and Baekje) by the Asuka period in the 5th to 6th centuries, at the latest by 512 AD when scholars of the Five Classics arrived from Baekje during the reign of Emperor Keitai, or by 554 AD when a divination scholar arrived during the reign of Emperor Kinmei."
"At first, the influence of these various studies on politics and culture was minimal, but in 602 (the 10th year of Empress Suiko), Kanro, who became a pioneer of Onmyodo in Japan, came from Baekje and began teaching various studies to 34 selected officials including Prince Shotoku, greatly influencing our country's politics."
"For the first time in Japan, the calendar (Genka calendar) was adopted as the official calendar, and in order to absorb Buddhist teachings, Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy, and calendar methods, diplomatic missions were sent to Sui, an advanced civilization, starting in 607 (Emperor Suiko's 15th year). The influence of Yin-Yang Five Elements philosophy became prominent in the establishment of Prince Shotoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution and the Twelve-Level Cap and Rank System."
"Afterwards, the imperial court continued to send exchange students with the missions to Sui (later Tang) dynasty, and invited many monks or scholars from the western coast of the Korean Peninsula or mainland China to further absorb knowledge."
"As the introduction of various studies progresses, it has become important in Japan to consider the movement and positions of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and to predict the future by judging good and bad fortune based on the principles of the Five Elements generating and overcoming each other, in order to obtain guidance for all kinds of human affairs. As a strategy to determine good and bad fortune and obtain a code of conduct, the Yin and Yang Five Elements philosophy has come to be valued."
"In the 7th century, Emperor Tenmu, who was a master of astrology and had a deep understanding of yin-yang and the five elements, took a divining rod during the Jinshin Rebellion to predict the future. In 676 (the 4th year of Emperor Tenmu's reign), he established the ""Onmyoryo"" and Japan's first observatory."
"In the year 685 (13th year of the Tenmu Emperor), the term ""Onmyoji"" began to be used, and the Yin-Yang Five Elements ideology became even more popular. In the Yoro Ritsuryo of 718, the establishment of the Onmyoryo as a bureau within the Nakatsukasano Naishoku of the Ministry of Central Affairs was officially recognized. It was stipulated that the bureau would have permanent officials such as astronomers, Onmyoji, calendar experts, and meteorologists, who, alongside the diviners of the Jingikan, would be responsible for conducting official divinations."
"Those responsible for introducing continental technologies are typically individuals skilled in such technologies. Therefore, various doctors and onmyoji who are knowledgeable in various fields and proficient in reading Chinese texts have been appointed, generally consisting of immigrants from mainland China who were under the control of the Han, Later Han, Sui dynasties that succeeded them in mainland China, Goguryeo and Baekje which held power on the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, and occasionally scholar-monks who returned from Silla, which was initially a power on the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula."
"In particular, following the defeat in the Battle of Baekgang in 663 AD (2nd year of Tenji), in which Japan sent troops to aid its close ally Baekje, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula and the Baekje dynasty was destroyed. During this time, many intellectuals from Baekje came as refugees, and many of them were appointed to official positions."
"The original techniques of the Onmyoryo at the time of its establishment were purely divination, feng shui (similar to what is now called ""feng shui""), astronomical observation, astrology, calendar creation, determination of auspicious and inauspicious days, and handling of the calendar only. Therefore, they mainly predicted astronomical observations, managed the calendar, and judged the auspiciousness of events based on theoretical analysis according to the principles of Yin and Yang. They did not perform any religious rituals or sorcery like Shingi officials or monks, but played an important role in selecting auspicious days for construction projects at the imperial court and in determining the auspiciousness of locations and directions during events such as the relocation of the capital."
